\subsection*{Institutional Context and Data}\label{sec: context and data}

In Chile, upon reaching retirement age, individuals must convert their savings into a stream of retirement income by selecting a pension product. Retirees are  not allowed to make lump-sum withdrawals.

The most common choice is to purchase an annuity from an insurance company. This choice entails the individual giving up ownership of their savings in exchange for longevity insurance\footnote{If the individual does not purchase an annuity, they risk exhausting their savings.}: the insurance company contracts an obligation to pay a fixed, inflation-adjusted amount for the remaining duration of the retiree’s lives.


% The retiree therefore transfers their longevity risk to the insurance company but gives up the possibility of bequeathing part of their pension savings.

%Retirees opting for a Phased Withdrawal (PW) maintain their savings accounts under PFA management and make systematic withdrawals based on an actuarial formula set by the government.  Under this arrangement, retirees retain ownership of their remaining savings, which can be passed on as an inheritance if they die prematurely. However, they bear the risk of outliving their savings, as pension payments decline over time until the account is depleted. Retirees under PW are also exposed to fluctuations in interest rates, leading to potential volatility in the value of their pension savings.

%As an alternative to the Phased Withdrawal, the retiree can purchase an annuity from an insurance company. This choice entails the individual giving up ownership of their savings i n exchange for longevity insurance: the insurance company contracts an obligation to pay a fixed, inflation-adjusted amount for the remaining duration of the retiree’s lives. The retiree therefore transfers their longevity risk to the insurance company but gives up the possibility of bequeathing part of their pension savings.

Retirees have the ability to tailor their annuity contracts, particularly by selecting guarantee and deferral options. A guarantee period ensures that the annuity will continue to make payments for a minimum period, offering some protection against early death while still allowing for a potential bequest. Retirees can also allocate a portion of their savings to purchase a deferred annuity, using the remaining balance to increase initial payouts. It is possible to combine guarantee and deferral features within a single contract.

 

\textbf{Centralized exchange}

By regulation, the process that leads to the purchase of an annuity takes place in SCOMP.  Established in 2004, SCOMP was designed to enhance retirees' access to information about their available options and to simplify the process of obtaining and comparing offers from various insurance companies %and PFAs
 (CMF, 2019). Individuals who have accumulated savings above a minimum threshold can request quotes for annuities with different combinations of guarantee and deferral periods. These quote requests are circulated to all insurance companies active in the market, accompanied only by basic information: the retiree’s age, gender, marital status, the age of any legal beneficiaries, and the total amount of savings. Each insurer then decides whether to respond with a quote for each requested pension product.

 
 

 All offers 
 %— including Phased Withdrawal offers from PFAs and annuity offers from insurance companies — 
 are compiled into a  document called the Offers Certificate (see figure \ref{fig:offer_ann1}), which is mailed to the retiree.
 % All quotes must be stated in "UF," an inflation-indexed unit of account, ensuring that annuity values are presented in real terms.
Retirees also receive information about the risk rating assigned to each insurance company, an important consideration since retirees are only partially protected in the event of insurer insolvency. 
 
Once they receive the Offers Certificate, retirees can either accept one of the offers, postpone their decision, or request a revised offer, which is an updated offer from the insurance companies to improve the initial offer. If the retiree is paying an intermediary he will contact the insurers asking for better terms, otherwise the retiree must physically visit the branch of the insurance company. Firms are prohibited from offering worse terms during this stage. On average external offers represent increases of around 2\% compared to the original SCOMP offer (\cite{illanes_retirement_2019}). In 2025 the regulator decided to ban revised offers, arguing that they created incentives for insurers not to provide their best offers in the first stage. 

%The number of retirees using SCOMP has increased through time, reaching over 50, 000 in 2018, at which point the annual value of the pension market was over 6 billion dollars.
From 2004 onwards, 19 insurance companies have participated in the annuity market. 
%For a majority of them, annuities constitute an important business line, making up over 60\% of both revenues and liabilities. 
Insurance companies are differentiated by their risk rating, an evaluation of their creditworthiness assessed periodically by two independent agencies. The regulator explicitly forbids the bundling of pension products with other types of insurance. Nevertheless, insurance companies might also differ in terms of their customer service, office locations and brand appeal.

\subsection*{Data}

Centralized offer exchange database SCOMP, available from the regulating agencies, which contains all retirees from August 2004 until July 2020. This database includes basic demographic information about retirees – age, gender, and legal dependents – total savings, geographic location at the city/precinct level. The data also records every offer received by each potential retiree, information about intermediation, pension product accepted, and commission paid. Finally, I also observe the date of death if it occurs before July 2021. I complement this information with publicly available reports on insurance companies’ risk ratings, information about the number of intermediaries, and their registered locations. 



The great advantage of the setting and associated data is that:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item We observe selected and non-selected offers. Most datasets in insurance/credit markets observe only the purchased offer (\cite{cosconati_competing_2025,allen_search_2019,cuesta_price_2018}).
    
    \item We observe all the information observed by the firms, given that it is a centralized market and all the offers are made based on the same information set.
\end{enumerate}


\subsection*{Research questions and motivation}

%Our research question is: what are the equilibrium impacts of external offers? 

In many consumer markets with individualized pricing—such as mortgages, auto loans, and insurance—competition does not end with the first quote: consumers routinely use initial offers to obtain improved revised offers from rival firms. For example a website advising how to get better mortgage terms suggests consumers to ask their lender: 

”I’ve received quotes from [competitor] for less for the same coverage. What can you do to help me stay with your company?"

This two-stage pricing environment is not an innocuous detail. The option to request external offers shapes how aggressively firms price in the first stage, how much consumers search and disclose competing quotes, and which consumers actually benefit from bargaining. In principle, revised offers could intensify competition, but they could also induce firms to soften initial offers, target concessions only to sophisticated or high-value customers, or deter some consumers from searching at all.

In this research we would like to understand what are the equilibrium impacts of revised offers. 



 
%\subsection*{Estimation}
%Estimation of the demand model can be done via ML: 
%\begin{enumerate}
%    \item Estimate  ($\delta_{jt}, \alpha_k$) to maximize the likelihood 
%    \item Use $\mathbb{E}[\delta_{jt}|x_{jt},x_{-jt}]= 0$ to estimate ($\beta, \xi_j, \xi_{jt}$)
%\end{enumerate}

%Moreover, if we assume that firms use the mortality tables published by the regulator to create beliefs over the remaining time, then from equation \ref{eq:FOC_simplified} we can recover the financing costs of the firms. Note that in this case identifying firm-specific financing costs -firm specific $\bar{r}_{jt}$ would be possible. 

%The fixed cost is identified from the variation in choosing to apply for external offers. 

 

%\subsection*{Model}
%We model the demand and supply for annuities and how it interacts with the aftermarket. 

%\textbf{Demand}
 
%Individuals are indexed by $i\in \mathcal{I}$, they are grouped into types depending on their observed characteristics (age, gender, marital status, age of legal beneficiaries and savings decile). Types are indexed by $k \in \mathcal{K}$, with $k(i)$ being the type of individual $i$, insurers are indexed by $j\in \mathcal{J}$.  The utility of $i$ when accepting offer $j$ is: 

%\begin{align}\label{eq:utility}
%   u_{ijt} = \beta X_{jt}+ \alpha_{k(i)} r_{ij} + \xi_j +\xi_{jt} + \varepsilon_{ijt}   
%\end{align}

%where $r_{ij}$ is the interest rate, $X_{jt}$  are insurer characteristics (credit-rating, number of customer service offices), $\xi_j$ are persistent unobserved insurer characteristics, and  $\xi_{jt}$ are mean-zero demand shocks.  
%The distinctive feature is that the interest rate is at the individual level, for estimation it requires individual level prices. 

%Define the mean utility $\delta_{jt} = \beta X_{jt} + \xi_j + \xi_{jt}$, $J_i$ the set of insurers who send an offer to individual $i$ and $Y_i$ the savings of $i$. 

%Assume that insurers offer a single price for all individuals of a given type,  and the set of insurers making an offer is the same within a type of individuals. In this case, for any individual of type $k$ the probability of buying an annuity from $j$ is: 


%\begin{align*}
%    s_{kj} = Pr_{kj}((r_{kj})_{j}|\theta, X) = \frac{\exp(\delta_{jt} + \alpha_{k}r_{kj})}{\sum_{j'\in J_k}\exp(\delta_{kt} + \alpha_kr_{ik'})}
%\end{align*}


%\textbf{Supply model}

%Besides being differentiated, insurers differ in two other ways: their beliefs about the mortality of individuals and their financing costs.

%Insurer use mortality tables to price annuities. Denote by $P_k(a)$ the probability that the individual of type $k$ survives at least $a$ additional periods.

%Insurer's financing cost is denoted by $\bar{r}_t$, then the profits derived from enrolling an individual $i$ of type $k$ when making an offer $F_{j}$ are:
