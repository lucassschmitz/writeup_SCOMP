    abstract = {Previous research has documented an “annuity puzzle”, the empirical regularity that retirees hold too small a fraction of wealth in annuities. To understand the role of pension system design in creating this puzzle, we study Chile’s pension system, where the annuitization rate is over 70\%. By estimating retiree preferences for retirement assets and the cost of annuitization, we show that Chile’s exception to the annuity puzzle is driven by the lack of a mandatory social insurance component and by restrictions on lump sum withdrawals. Reforming these rules would lower annuitization rates and average welfare, but would increase welfare for those at the highest levels of longevity risk. We establish that different coverage levels for mandatory insurance induce a trade-off between providing protection for longevity risk and average welfare, and provide guidance for policy makers seeking to reform the rules governing how retirees can access their retirement savings.},
