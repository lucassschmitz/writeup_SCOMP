Prices are determined by zero-profit conditions, and the set of traded contracts is determined by free entry. Crucially for applications, contract characteristics are endogenously determined, consumers may have multiple dimensions of private information, and an equilibrium always exists. Equilibrium corresponds to the limit of a differentiated products Bertrand game. We apply the model to establish theoretical results on the equilibrium effects of mandates. Mandates can increase efficiency but have unintended consequences. With adverse selection, an insurance mandate reduces the price of low-coverage policies, which necessarily has indirect effects such as increasing adverse selection on the intensive margin and causing some consumers to purchase less coverage.},

Using about 265,000 sequences of a game of alternating-offer bargaining following an ascending auction in the wholesale used-car industry, this study estimates (or bounds) distributions of buyer and seller values and evaluates where realized bargaining outcomes lie relative to efﬁcient outcomes. Results demonstrate that the ex-ante and ex-post efﬁcient outcomes are close to one another, but that the real bargaining falls short of both, suggesting that the bargaining is indeed inefﬁcient but that this inefﬁciency is not solely due to the information constraints highlighted in Myerson and Satterthwaite (1983). Quantitatively, ﬁndings indicate that over one-half of failed negotiations are cases where gains from trade exist, leading an efﬁciency loss of 12–23\% of the available gains from trade.},

            We study patterns of behavior in bilateral bargaining situations using a rich new data set describing back-and-forth sequential bargaining occurring in over 25 million listings from eBay’s Best Offer platform. We compare observed behavior to predictions from the large theoretical bargaining literature. One-third of bargaining interactions end in immediate agreement, as predicted by complete-information models. The majority of sequences play out differently, ending in disagreement or delayed agreement, which have been rationalized by incomplete information models. We find that stronger bargaining power and better outside options improve agents’ outcomes. Robust empirical findings that existing models cannot rationalize include reciprocal (and gradual) concession behavior and delayed disagreement. Another robust pattern at odds with existing theory is that players exhibit a preference for making and accepting offers that split the difference between the two most recent offers. These observations suggest that behavioral norms, which are neither incorporated nor explained by existing theories, play an important role in the success of bargaining outcomes.},

The buyer has an outside option, which is modeled as a sequential search process during which he can choose to return to bargaining at any time. Two cases are considered: In Regime I, both agents have symmetric information about the search parameters. We ﬁnd that, in contrast to bargaining with complete information, the option to return to bargaining is not redundant in equilibrium. However, the no-delay result still holds. In Regime II, where agents have asymmetric information about the outside option, delay is possible. The solution characterizes the parameters for renegotiation and those for search with no return to the bargaining table.},

The main results show that the proﬁt-maximizing mechanism induces a set of buyer types to delay purchasing a good if the value of the outside option is highly dispersed among buyer types. Moreover, to prevent a buyer from quitting a negotiation, the proﬁt-maximizing mechanism also features an upfront payment, which is compensated later by a price discount. The seller can implement the proﬁt-maximizing mechanism by offering a declining price path or a menu of European options.},

	abstract = {In his Nobel Prize acceptance speech given in 1985, Franco Modigliani drew attention to the “annuitization puzzle”: that annuity contracts, other than pensions through group insurance, are extremely rare. Rational choice theory predicts that households will find annuities attractive at the onset of retirement because they address the risk of outliving one's income, but in fact, relatively few of those facing retirement choose to annuitize a substantial portion of their wealth. There is now a substantial literature on the behavioral economics of retirement saving, which has stressed that both behavioral and institutional factors play an important role in determining a household's saving accumulations. Self-control problems, inertia, and a lack of financial sophistication inhibit some households from providing an adequate retirement nest egg. However, interventions such as automatic enrollment and automatic escalation of saving over time as wages rise (the “save more tomorrow” plan) have shown success in overcoming these obstacles. We will show that the same behavioral and institutional factors that help explain savings behavior are also important in understanding 1) how families handle the process of decumulation once retirement commences and 2) why there seems to be so little demand to annuitize wealth at retirement.},

	abstract = {Government intervention in insurance markets is ubiquitous and the theoretical basis for such intervention, based on classic work from the 1970s, has been the problem of adverse selection. Over the last decade, empirical work on selection in insurance markets has gained considerable momentum. This research finds that adverse selection exists in some insurance markets but not in others. And it has uncovered examples of markets that exhibit “advantageous selection”—a phenomenon not considered by the original theory, and one that has different consequences for equilibrium insurance allocation and optimal public policy than the classical case of adverse selection. Advantageous selection arises when the individuals who are willing to pay the most for insurance are those who are the most risk averse (and so have the lowest expected cost). Indeed, it is natural to think that in many instances individuals who value insurance more may also take action to lower their expected costs: drive more carefully, invest in preventive health care, and so on. Researchers have taken steps toward estimating the welfare consequences of detected selection and of potential public policy interventions. In this essay, we present a graphical framework for analyzing both theoretical and empirical work on selection in insurance markets. This graphical approach provides both a useful and intuitive depiction of the basic theory of selection and its implications for welfare and public policy, as well as a lens through which one can understand the ideas and limitations of existing empirical work on this topic.},

We ask how reliable these estimates are when the researcher’s model may be misspecified. We focus on the case of multivariate, potentially nonlinear models where the causal variable of interest is endogenous. Reliable estimates require that the researcher’s model is flexible enough to describe the effects of the endogenous variable approximately correctly. Reliable estimates do not require that the researcher has correctly specified the role of the exogenous controls in the model. However, if the role of the controls is misspecified, reliable estimates require a property we call strong exclusion. Strong exclusion depends on having sufficiently many instruments that are unrelated to the controls. We discuss how practitioners can achieve strong exclusion, and illustrate our findings with an application to a differentiated goods model of demand for beer.},

	abstract = {This paper studies the relationships between consumer demand and public health in firearm markets, and their roles in determining the impacts of firearm regulation. My analysis uses 20 years of administrative data from California, recording all licit handgun purchases in the state, the consumer and retailer in each transaction, and the universe of gun and non-gun fatalities. Isolating variation from the entry timing of firearm retailers in local markets, the presence of a first firearm retailer increases handgun purchases by 30 percent. The purchases on the margin of retailer entry are made by both repeat and first-time handgun purchasers, and these marginal handgun owners increase both homicide and suicide fatalities. To study the trade-off between consumer surplus and public health, I develop and estimate a model of consumer handgun purchase and its impact on fatalities. My estimates imply that handgun owners are adversely selected—those with a higher willingness to pay for a handgun also generate more expected fatalities—such that the expected public health costs of handgun ownership outweigh the private benefits of handgun purchase. Using the model to simulate counterfactual policies, California’s 2024 statewide sales tax on firearm purchase approximately maximizes tax revenues, but is too low when jointly accounting for consumer surplus and public health. More efficient policies target high tax rates to areas where marginal handgun purchasers have lower willingness to pay and higher expected fatalities. In particular, county-specific taxes could achieve a larger reduction in homicides and a smaller drop in consumer surplus by setting high tax rates around San Francisco and Los Angeles, while leaving the rest of the state at the status quo.},

Policymakers have raised concerns that the practice of sellers oﬀering buyers’ brokers commissions can lead to high commissions and harm consumers. This paper empirically examines the equilibrium impacts of a proposed policy called “decoupling,” which would require buyers and sellers to each pay their respective brokers. I develop a structural model integrating buyers, sellers, and brokers to characterize the equilibrium house prices, commissions, and to assess the welfare impacts of the policy. I estimate the model with rich observed heterogeneity and credible sources of identifying variation using shifters of house prices and commissions. I ﬁnd that decoupling reduces commissions paid by 53\%, as sellers no longer have to oﬀer high commissions to attract buyers, and brokers compete for price-sensitive buyers. Sellers and buyers experience a surplus gain of 4\% of the total transaction value from having higher net proceeds than the status quo. I ﬁnd notable surplus gains for buyers across income groups as sellers pass through part of their commission savings to house prices.},

Counterfactual simulations demonstrate that removing dealer advantages increases search frictions, distorts market allocation, and reduces welfare. In particular, weakening dealers’ spatial advantage in matching or reducing their presence shifts trade toward less eﬀicient direct channels. These findings highlight how search frictions and geographic constraints shape intermediaries’ behavior, affecting both market eﬀiciency and the surplus distribution.},

	abstract = {Platforms, retailers, and other firms often offer their own products alongside products sold by competitors, but this form of vertical integration has become a target of regulation in digital markets. We study the effects of this practice through a field experiment that hides brands owned by Amazon (i.e., private labels) from shoppers on Amazon.com. We first consider the effects of this removal on three aspects of consumer behavior: substitution to other products, changes in search effort, and substitution to other retail websites. In the absence of Amazon brands, our results indicate that consumers substitute toward products that are similar along most observable dimensions. We find no evidence that treated consumers change their search effort, nor that they shift their shopping behavior to other retail websites. To evaluate a fourth mechanism—how the presence of Amazon brands affects equilibrium prices—we estimate a structural model of demand and simulate counterfactual prices when removing such products. Our estimates imply that, for the categories we study, removing Amazon brands would reduce consumer surplus by 3.8 percent in the short run, and roughly one quarter of the impact is due to equilibrium price increases by other products. The effects are heterogeneous, with consumer surplus reductions exceeding 10 percent in some categories, while other categories realize no change or even positive increases in consumer surplus when Amazon brands are removed.},

We propose two algorithms to compute a stationary equilibrium with econometric shocks, one that solves the stationary equilibrium equations with a non linear solver, the other that reformulates the problem as a min-max problem. We adapt both algorithms for estimation, and use the methods developed to estimate a model of geographic mobility costs for Swedish engineers.

	abstract = {This paper reviews a framework for numerically analyzing dynamic interactions in imperfectly competitive industries. The framework dates back to Ericson and Pakes [1995. Review of Economic Studies 62, 53–82], but it is based on equilibrium notions that had been available for some time before, and it has been extended in many ways by different authors since. The framework requires as input a set of primitives which describe the institutional structure in the industry to be analyzed. The framework outputs proﬁts and policies for every incumbent and potential entrant at each possible state of the industry. These policies can be used to simulate the distribution of sample paths for all ﬁrms from any initial industry structure. The sample paths generated by the model can be quite different depending on the primitives, and most of the extensions were designed to enable the framework to accommodate empirically relevant cases that required modiﬁcation of the initial structure. The sample paths possess similar properties to those observed in (the recently available) panel data sets on industries. These sample paths can be used either for an analysis of the likely response to a policy or an environmental change, or as the model’s implication in an estimation algorithm. We begin with a review of an elementary version of the framework and a report on what is known about its analytic properties. Much of the rest of the paper deals with computational issues. We start with an introduction to iterative techniques for computing equilibrium that are analogous to the techniques used to compute the solution to single agent dynamic programming problems. This includes discussions of the determinants of the computational burden of these techniques, and the mechanism implicitly used to select an equilibrium when multiple equilibria are possible. We then outline a number of techniques that might be used to reduce the computational burden of the iterative algorithm. This section includes discussions of both the implications of differences in modeling assumptions used in the alternative techniques, and a discussion of the likely relevance of the different techniques for different institutional structures. A separate section reports on a technique for computing multiple equilibria from the same set of primitives. The paper concludes with a review of applications of the framework and a brief discussion of areas where further development of the framework would seem warranted.},

Wages are determined each period in a transferable utility matching game that equates supply and demand for each position. Estimation takes about as much computer time as solving the game once. I use data on almost all elite Swedish engineers in the private sector from 1970–1990 to examine the relationship between market thickness and switching. A counterfactual experiment investigates how many workers a new entrant ﬁrm can hire through voluntary switching in the absence of incumbent ﬁrms shutting down and laying off workers.},

	abstract = {Competition in health insurance markets may fail to improve health outcomes if consumers are not able to identify high-quality plans. We develop and apply a novel instrumental variables framework to quantify the variation in causal mortality effects across plans and measure how much consumers attend to this variation. We first document large differences in the observed mortality rates of Medicare Advantage plans in local markets. We then show that when plans with high mortality rates exit these markets, enrollees tend to switch to more typical plans and subsequently experience lower mortality. We derive and validate a novel “fallback condition” governing the subsequent choices of those affected by plan exits. When the fallback condition is satisfied, plan terminations can be used to estimate the relationship between observed plan mortality rates and causal mortality effects. Applying the framework, we find that mortality rates unbiasedly predict causal mortality effects. We then extend our framework to study other predictors of plan mortality effects and estimate consumer willingness to pay. Higher-spending plans tend to reduce enrollee mortality, but existing quality ratings are uncorrelated with plan mortality effects. Consumers place little weight on mortality effects when choosing plans. Good insurance plans dramatically reduce mortality, and redirecting consumers to such plans could improve beneficiary health.},

Moreover, this structural break coincided with the submission of a new draft pension law proposing greater transparency in annuity markets and a generalized drop in broker commissions. The high commissions charged in the 1990s were partly returned to annuitants as informal (and illegal) cash rebates. Myopic pensioners preferred cash rebates over present values. Thus, the legal threat caused the drop in broker commissions, reduced the illegal practice of cash rebates, increased competition via annuity rates, and raised the long-run elasticity to one.},

Money's worth calculations show that the market is efficient by international standards, with a money's worth above 0.9 for the whole period and close to unity by the end of the period.

The same variation, together with cost data, allows us to estimate how insurers' costs vary as market participants endogenously respond to price. The slope of this estimated cost curve provides a direct test for both the existence and the nature of selection, and the combination of demand and cost curves can be used to estimate welfare.We illustrate our approach by applying it to data on employer-provided health insurance from one specific company. We detect adverse selection but estimate that the quantitative welfare implications associated with inefficient pricing in our particular application are small, in both absolute and relative terms.},

	abstract = {This paper analyzes the consumer-welfare effects of intermediaries in a pension and annuity market with adverse selection. Intermediaries provide advice, helping individuals improve decisions when understanding products is complex and costly, but may introduce distortions due to agency problems. In an insurance market, intermediary effects on choices can impact adverse selection and, through it, prices. I document the importance of intermediation and its connection to adverse selection in the Chilean pension market, where products are complex and intermediaries have a ﬁnancial incentive to steer consumers toward annuities. To quantify the effects of potential intermediary regulations, I develop and estimate a dynamic demand model that includes life-cycle decisions, product, and intermediation choices. I ﬁnd intermediaries have the potential to improve welfare: retirees would give up around 250 USD a year to eliminate frictions in product choices. Despite intermediaries steering a majority of their customers into annuities, a ban on intermediation is approximately consumer-welfare neutral. The variety of annuities allows intermediaries to recommend close substitutes to the outside option, limiting the harm from misaligned incentives. Decision costs without intermediaries and annuity price increases due to adverse selection erode any gains from a ban. In light of policy concerns regarding the role of intermediaries, my results highlight the potential value provided by advisors – even with biased incentives – when choices are complex and stakes are high.},

Customers who base their decisions on intermediaries’ recommendations are less sensitive to price changes. Our model shows that prices may move in the opposite direction to the intermediaries’ bias. When intermediaries are cheaper and less biased, more customers follow their advice, making demand less elastic. This change induces ﬁrms to increase prices, producing nontrivial eﬀects on welfare.

It leads to inconsistency with standard estimation methods that maintain independence between the model's error and the included variables. The authors describe a control function approach for handling endogeneity in choice models. Observed variables and economic theory are used to derive controls for the dependence between the endogenous variable and the demand error. The theory points to the relationships that contain information on the unobserved demand factor, such as the pricing equation and the advertising equation. The authors' approach is an alternative to Berry, Levinsohn, and Pakes's (1995) product-market controls for unobserved quality. The authors apply both methods to examine households' choices among television options, including basic and premium cable packages, in which unobserved attributes, such as quality of programming, are expected to be correlated with price. Without correcting for endogeneity, aggregate demand is estimated to be upward-sloping, suggesting that omitted attributes are positively correlated with demand. Both the control function method and the product-market controls method produce downward-sloping demand estimates that are similar.},

Deferred acceptance algorithms are at the basis of a number of labor market clearinghouses around the world, and have recently been implemented in school choice systems in Boston and New York City. In addition, the study of markets that have failed in ways that can be fixed with centralized mechanisms has led to a deeper understanding of some of the tasks a marketplace needs to accomplish to perform well. In particular, marketplaces work well when they provide thickness to the market, help it deal with the congestion that thickness can bring, and make it safe for participants to act effectively on their preferences. Centralized clearinghouses organized around the deferred acceptance algorithm can have these properties, and this has sometimes allowed failed markets to be reorganized.},

In contrast, a ‘cost-based’ reimbursement system is shown to result in too many services being provided. Competition between hospitals for physicians will tend to augment both of these problems. We also examine a mixed reimbursement system, in which hospital reimbursements are paid partly prospectively and partly cost-based. This system is shown under a variety of circumstances to be superior to the other two reimbursement systems by improving the incentives for the efficient level of services, reducing incentives to unnecessarily admit or reclassify patients, and reducing risk to providers.},

In such settings, we analyze how an insurer or social planner divides cost-sharing between risk-averse consumers (e.g. patients) and firms (e.g. doctors). Consumer cost-sharing is needed for two purposes. First, controlling “extensive margin” moral hazard beyond the direct reach of firms, such as the choice of whether to see a doctor. Second, as a second-best solution to contracting frictions, such as asymmetric information about doctor effort. Firm cost-sharing otherwise achieves first-best outcomes. As firm market power increases, the optimal firm contract takes an especially simple form: firm cost-sharing is linear and inversely proportional to the relative impact of consumer and firm cost-sharing on expenditures. We estimate this parameter for drugs in medicare: a dollar of physician paperwork costs is 50x more impactful than a dollar of consumer cost-sharing, implying that insurers should use small physician penalties as the primary means of cost-control.},

In the short run, they anticipate their purchases to avoid delegating to a central body. In the longer run, they both manipulate contract values, breaking down purchases into smaller lots of amounts below the thresholds driving centralization requirements, and, when given the option, aggregate into the smallest types of centralized purchasing bodies. These three distortions partially oﬀset the potential beneﬁts of the centralization reforms.},

	abstract = {Innovations often combine several components to achieve outcomes greater than the “sum of the parts.” We argue that such combination innovations can introduce an understudied inefﬁciency—a positive market expansion externality that beneﬁts the owners of the components. We demonstrate the importance of this externality in the market for pharmaceutical cancer treatments, where drug combination therapies have proven highly effective. Using data on clinical trial investments, we document several facts consistent with inefﬁciently low private innovation: ﬁrms are less likely than publicly funded researchers to trial combinations, ﬁrms are less likely to trial combinations including other ﬁrms’ drugs than those including their own drugs, and ﬁrms often wait to trial combinations including other ﬁrms’ drugs until those drugs experience generic entry. Using microdata on drug prices and utilization, we quantify the externalities that arise from new combinations and ﬁnd that the market expansion externality often dominates the standard negative business stealing externality, suggesting too little innovation in combination therapies. As a result, ﬁrms may have incentives to free ride off others’ innovation, which we analyze with a dynamic structural model of innovation decisions. We use the model to design cost-effective policies that advance combination innovation. Redirecting publicly funded innovation toward combinations with high predicted market expansion or consumer surplus spillovers minimizes crowd out of private investments, increasing the rate of combination innovation and total welfare while remaining budget neutral.},

It uses a rich data set of cement and ready‐mixed concrete plants that spans several decades to perform a detailed case study. There is little evidence that foreclosure is quantitatively important in these industries. Instead, prices fall, quantities rise, and entry rates remain unchanged when markets become more integrated. These patterns are consistent, however, with an alternative efficiency‐based mechanism. Namely, higher‐productivity producers are more likely to vertically integrate and are also larger, more likely to survive, and more likely to charge lower prices. We find evidence that integrated producers’ productivity advantage is tied to improved logistics coordination afforded by large local concrete operations. Interestingly, this benefit is not due to firms’ vertical structures per se: nonvertical firms with large local concrete operations have similarly high productivity levels.},

I build a general equilibrium model in which heterogeneous workers and firms sort across cities and match within cities. Using Canadian matched employer–employee data, I estimate the model and find that the urban earnings premium is almost entirely explained by worker and firm sorting. The laissez-faire equilibrium is ineﬀicient as low-productivity firms overvalue locating in high-skilled cities. The optimal spatial policy would incentivize high-skilled workers and high-productivity firms to co-locate to a greater extent while redistributing income towards low-earning cities.

While the sorting of individuals into cities begets regional disparities, it may benefit aggregate productivity by fostering human capital accumulation. To study this equity-efficiency tradeoff, I propose a theory wherein individuals learn from the other workers in their cities. Cities affect the stock of human capital by determining the frequency at which heterogeneous workers meet. Learning complementarities determine the existence of a tradeoff between productivity and spatial inequality. I estimate the model on French administrative data. I recover learning complementarities from a local projection of future wages on present wages and the wages of nearby individuals. I find that workers employed in relatively skill-dense cities experience faster wage growth, and disproportionately so if they are skilled. I address endogeneity concerns by using skill-density variations within firms across neighborhoods driven by past productivity shocks. The model explains two-thirds of the between-city wage growth variance and gives rise to a steep tradeoff between aggregate human capital and spatial inequality. I assess the implications of this tradeoff for the general equilibrium effects of moving vouchers. I find that large vouchers are effective at reducing spatial disparities in human capital accumulation at the cost of decreased aggregate efficiency.},

I demonstrate that the decentralized equilibrium exhibits excessive concentration of workers and firms, and dispersing them away from dense locations can mitigate congestion without reducing output. I then provide direct empirical evidence of the two-sided sorting mechanism using German administrative microdata. An exogenous increase in the quality of the workforce in a location results in more productive firms choosing that location. Finally, to quantify the implications of the model, I calibrate it to U.S. regional data and show that policies that relocate workers and firms toward less dense areas can increase welfare.},

	abstract = {Cities have long been thought to drive economic growth. Despite this, analyses of spatial policies have largely ignored the eﬀects of such policies on growth. In this paper, I develop a spatial endogenous growth model in which heterogeneous agents make forward-looking migration decisions and human capital investments over the life cycle. Local externalities in the human capital investment technology drive both agglomeration and growth. I show that, along a balanced growth path, the growth rate depends on the spatial distribution of human capital, making it sensitive to spatial policies. I calibrate the model to data on U.S. metropolitan areas and show that it can rationalize the faster wage growth of workers in big cities, as well as other key patterns in life-cycle wage proﬁles, migration decisions, and city characteristics. Because workers accumulate human capital at diﬀerent rates depending on where they live, the model provides an environment in which spatial policy can not just attract skilled workers, but produce them, too. I ﬁnd that policies that further concentrate skilled workers in large cities are growth-enhancing.},

The model captures the role of labor mobility frictions, goods mobility frictions, geographic factors, and input-output linkages in determining equilibrium allocations. We show how to solve the equilibrium of the model and take the model to the data without assuming that the economy is at a steady state and without estimating productivities, migration frictions, or trade costs, which can be difficult to identify. We calibrate the model to 22 sectors, 38 countries, and 50 U.S. states. We study how the rise in China's trade for the period 2000 to 2007 impacted U.S. households across more than a thousand U.S. labor markets distinguished by sector and state. We find that the China trade shock resulted in a reduction of about 0.55 million U.S. manufacturing jobs, about 16\% of the observed decline in manufacturing employment from 2000 to 2007. The U.S. gains in the aggregate, but due to trade and migration frictions, the welfare and employment effects vary across U.S. labor markets. Estimated transition costs to the new long-run equilibrium are also heterogeneous and reflect the importance of accounting for labor dynamics.},

Even though the high-quality sellers would satisfy the standard in the absence of regulation, imposing a standard leads these sellers to raise qualities. They do so in an effort to alleviate the price competition, which intensifies as a result of the low-quality sellers' having raised their qualities to meet the imposed standard. However, by its very nature, a minimum quality standard limits the range in which producers can differentiate qualities. Hence, in the end, price competition intensifies, and prices--"corrected for quality change"--fall. Due to the better qualities and lower hedonic prices, and compared to the unregulated equilibrium, all consumers are better off, more consumers participate in the market, and ail participating consumers--including those who would consume qualities in excess of the standard in the absence of regulation--select higher qualities. When the consumption of high-quality products generates positive externalities--as in the case of safety products--these results favor minimum quality standards. I also show that even in the absence of externalities an appropriately chosen standard improves social welfare.},

This paper makes a stunningly good case for relying on purposefully randomized or accidentally randomized experiments to relieve the doubts that afflict inferences from nonexperimental data. On further reflection, I realized that I may have been overcome with irrational exuberance. Moreover, with this great honor bestowed on my "con" article, I couldn't easily throw this child of mine overboard. As Angrist and Pischke persuasively argue, either purposefully randomized experiments or accidentally randomized "natural" experiments can be extremely helpful, but Angrist and Pischke seem to me to overstate the potential benefits of the approach. I begin with some thoughts about the inevitable limits of randomization, and the need for sensitivity analysis in this area, as in all areas of applied empirical work. I argue that the recent financial catastrophe is a powerful illustration of the fact that extrapolating from natural experiments will inevitably be hazardous. I discuss how the difficulties of applied econometric work cannot be evaded with econometric innovations, offering as examples some under-recognized difficulties with instrumental variables and robust standard errors. I conclude with comments about the shortcomings of an experimentalist paradigm as applied to macroeconomics, and some warnings about the willingness of applied economists to apply push-button methodologies without sufficient hard thought regarding their applicability and shortcomings.},

Section 2 presents the theoretical framework, introduces the concept of Markov Perfect Nash Equilibrium, discusses existence and multiplicity, and describes the representation of this equilibrium in terms of conditional choice probabilities. We also discuss extensions of the basic framework, including models in continuous time, the concepts of oblivious equilibrium and experience-based equilibrium, and dynamic games where firms have non-equilibrium beliefs. In Section 3, we first provide an overview of the types of data used in this literature, before turning to a discussion of identification issues and results, and estimation methods. We review different methods to deal with multiple equilibria and large state spaces, describe recent developments for estimating games with serially correlated unobservables, and discuss the use of machine learning methods to solving and estimating dynamic games. Section 4 discusses empirical applications of dynamic games in IO. We start describing the first empirical applications in this literature during the early 2000s. Then, we review recent applications dealing with innovation, antitrust and mergers, dynamic pricing, regulation, product repositioning, advertising, uncertainty and investment, airline network competition, dynamic matching, and natural resources. We conclude with our view of the progress made in this literature and the remaining challenges.},

Determining which options were considered has previously required either survey data or restrictions on how attributes affect consideration or utility. We provide an alternative route. In full-consideration models, choice probabilities satisfy a symmetry property analogous to Slutsky symmetry in continuous-choice models. This symmetry breaks down in consideration set models when changes in characteristics perturb consideration. We show that consideration probabilities are constructively identified from the resulting asymmetries. We validate our approach in a lab experiment where consideration sets are known and then apply our framework to study a “smart default” policy in Medicare Part D, wherein consumers are automatically reassigned to lower-cost prescription drug plans with the option of opting out. Full-consideration models imply that such a policy will be ineffective because consumers will opt out to avoid switching costs. Allowing for inattention, we find that defaulting all consumers to lower-cost options produces negligible welfare benefits on average, but defaulting only consumers who would save at least \$300 produces large benefits.},

This approach does not require assumptions on the market structure or demand curves faced by firms, nor assumptions on how firms allocate their inputs across products. We exploit quantity and price information to disentangle markups from quantity-based productivity, and then compute marginal costs by dividing observed prices by the estimated markups. We use India’s trade liberalization episode to examine how firms adjust these performance measures. Not surprisingly, we find that trade liberalization lowers factory-gate prices and that output tariff declines have the expected pro-competitive effects. However, the price declines are small relative to the declines in marginal costs, which fall predominantly because of the input tariff liberalization. The reason for this incomplete cost pass-through to prices is that firms offset their reductions in marginal costs by raising markups. Our results demonstrate substantial heterogeneity and variability in markups across firms and time and suggest that producers benefited relative to consumers, at least immediately after the reforms.},

We distinguish three types of micro-foundations, based on sharing, matching, and learning mechanisms. For each of these three categories, we develop one or more core models in detail and discuss the literature in relation to those models. This allows us to give a precise characterisation of some of the main theoretical underpinnings of urban agglomeration economies, to discuss modelling issues that arise when working with these tools, and to compare different sources of agglomeration economies in terms of the aggregate urban outcomes they produce as well as in terms of their normative implications.},

This higher productivity may occur because more talented individuals sort into large cities, because large cities select more productive entrepreneurs and firms, or because of agglomeration economies. We develop a model of systems of cities that combines all three elements and suggests interesting complementarities between them. The model can replicate stylized facts about sorting, agglomeration, and selection in cities. It also generates Zipf’s law for cities under empirically plausible parameter values. Finally, it provides a useful framework within which to reinterpret extant empirical evidence.},

	abstract = {Traditional production functions rely on factor-neutral technology and functional form assumptions. These assumptions impose strong economic restrictions and are often empirically rejected. This paper develops a new method for estimating production functions with labor-augmenting technology and applies it to markup estimation. The method does not impose parametric restrictions and generalizes prior approaches that rely on the CES production function. I ﬁrst extend the canonical Olley-Pakes framework and then develop an identiﬁcation strategy based on a novel control variable approach and ﬁrst-order conditions. I use this method to estimate output elasticities and markups in manufacturing industries in the US and four developing countries. I ﬁnd that neglecting labor-augmenting productivity underestimates variable input elasticity, and overestimates markups in all countries. These biases also aﬀect markup growth: I estimate a more muted markup growth in the US manufacturing sector than recent estimates. My ﬁndings suggest that accommodating labor-augmenting productivity is crucial for markup estimation.},

I estimate a model of public housing preferences in a setting where heterogeneous apartments are rationed through waiting time.

We develop a dynamic model in which a ﬁrm’s exports in a market may depend on how similar the market is to the ﬁrm’s home country (gravity) and to its previous export destinations (extended gravity). Given the large number of export paths from which forward-looking ﬁrms may choose, we use a moment inequality approach to estimate our model. Our estimates indicate that sharing similarities with a prior export destination in terms of geographic location, language, and income per capita jointly reduces the cost of foreign market entry by 69–90\%. Reductions due to geographic location (25–38\%) and language (29–36\%) have the largest effect. Extended gravity thus has a large impact on export entry costs.},

We find that increases in worker eligibility for urban residence registration (Hukou) across origindestination pairs increase rural-urban exports, imports, capital inflows and outflows, both in terms of bilateral transaction values and the number of unique buyer-seller matches. To quantify the implications at the regional level, we interpret these estimates through the lens of a simple spatial equilibrium model in which migrants can lead to a reduction in bilateral buyer-seller matching frictions. We find that a 10\% increase in a rural county’s migration market access leads to a 1.5\% increase in the county’s trade market access and a 2.5\% increase in investment market access. In the context of China’s recent Hukou reforms, we find that these additional gains in market integration were on average larger among the urban destinations compared to the rural origins, reinforcing incentives for rural-urban migration.},

Based on this exercise, we estimate that the voucher generated welfare gains exceeding four times the average private school's annual tuition on average to the students induced into private schooling. The second step of the research design will validate the estimated welfare impacts by comparing model predictions for a simulated voucher program in control markets with the data from the treatment group. The results in this paper are based on the first step (using only control data) and this draft serves as a pre-commitment to the model estimates and predictions before examining the experimental data.},

The availability of the experiment also allows us to estimate the program's general equilibrium effects, which we then incorporate into our simulations.

	abstract = {We document the evolution of market power based on firm-level data for the U.S. economy since 1955. We measure both markups and profitability. In 1980, aggregate markups start to rise from 21\% above marginal cost to 61\% now. The increase is driven mainly by the upper tail of the markup distribution: the upper percentiles have increased sharply. Quite strikingly, the median is unchanged. In addition to the fattening upper tail of the markup distribution, there is reallocation of market share from low- to high-markup firms. This rise occurs mostly within industry. We also find an increase in the average profit rate from 1\% to 8\%. Although there is also an increase in overhead costs, the markup increase is in excess of overhead. We discuss the macroeconomic implications of an increase in average market power, which can account for a number of secular trends in the past four decades, most notably the declining labor and capital shares as well as the decrease in labor market dynamism.},

	abstract = {This paper studies whether removing barriers to trade induces efficiency gains for producers. Like almost all empirical work which relies on a production function to recover productivity measures, I do not observe physical output at the firm level. Therefore, it is imperative to control for unobserved prices and demand shocks. I develop an empirical model that combines a demand system with a production function to generate estimates of productivity. I rely on my framework to identify the productivity effects from reduced trade protection in the Belgian textile market. This trade liberalization provides me with observed demand shifters that are used to separate out the associated price, scale, and productivity effects. Using a matched plant–product level data set and detailed quota data, I find that correcting for unobserved prices leads to substantially lower productivity gains. More specifically, abolishing all quota protections increases firm-level productivity by only 2 percent as opposed to 8 percent when relying on standard measures of productivity. My results beg for a serious reevaluation of a long list of empirical studies that document productivity responses to major industry shocks and, in particular, to opening up to trade. My findings imply the need to study the impact of changes in the operating environment on productivity together with market power and prices in one integrated framework. The suggested method and identification strategy are quite general and can be applied whenever it is important to distinguish between revenue productivity and physical productivity.},

            We study the effects of becoming a supplier to multinational corporations (MNCs) using tax data tracking firm-to-firm transactions in Costa Rica. Event study estimates reveal that domestic firms experience strong and persistent gains in performance after supplying to a first MNC buyer. Four years after, domestic firms employ 26\% more workers and have a 4\% to 9\% higher total factor productivity (TFP). These effects are unlikely to be explained by demand effects or changes in tax compliance. Moreover, suppliers experience a large drop in their sales to all other buyers except the first MNC buyer in the year of the event, followed by a gradual recovery. The dynamics of adjustment in sales to others suggests that firms face short-run capacity constraints that relax over time. Four years later, the sales to others grow by 20\%. Most of this growth comes from the acquisition of new buyers, which tend to be “better buyers” (e.g., larger and with more stable supplier relationships). Finally, we collected survey data from domestic firms and MNCs to provide further insights into the wide-ranging benefits of supplying to MNCs. According to our surveys, these benefits range from better managerial practices to a better reputation.},

Counterfactual simulations indicate that removing all excess barriers faced by women entrepreneurs would substantially increase the fraction of female-owned ﬁrms, female LFP, earnings, and generate substantial gains for the economy. These gains are due to higher LFP, higher real wages and proﬁts, and reallocation: low productivity maleowned ﬁrms previously sheltered from female competition are replaced by higher productivity female-owned ﬁrms previously excluded from the economy.},

            This paper investigates the consequences of bureaucratic discretion in public procurement. I exploit a Hungarian policy reform, which allows a “high-discretion” procedure below a certain contract value. At the threshold, I document large discontinuities both in procurement outcomes and in the density of contract values, which indicates that buyers manipulate contract values to avoid auctions. I combine the reform and a structural model to find that discretion increases prices and results in the selection of less productive contractors. I also show that high discretion benefits firms with connections to the party of the central government. I use the structural model to document that public buyers are willing to sacrifice more contract value to increase their discretion if more connected firms are operating in the market. I also use the model to simulate the effects of counterfactual procurement thresholds on different procurement outcomes.},

While both constrained and unconstrained ﬁrms may be willing to absorb all the directed credit that they can get (because it may be cheaper than other sources of credit), constrained ﬁrms will use it to expand production, while unconstrained ﬁrms will primarily use it as a substitute for other borrowing. We apply these observations to ﬁrms in India that became eligible for directed credit as a result of a policy change in 1998, and lost eligibility as a result of the reversal of this reform in 2000, and to smaller ﬁrms that were already eligible for the preferential credit before 1998 and remained eligible in 2000. Comparing the trends in the sales and the proﬁts of these two groups of ﬁrms, we show that there is no evidence that directed credit is being used as a substitute for other forms of credit. Instead, the credit was used to ﬁnance more production–there was a large acceleration in the rate of growth of sales and proﬁts for these ﬁrms in 1998, and a corresponding decline in 2000. There was no change in trends around either date for the small ﬁrms. We conclude that many of the ﬁrms must have been severely credit constrained, and that the marginal rate of return to capital was very high for these ﬁrms.},

We study the relationship between discretion and corruption in Italian government procurement auctions, using a confidential database of firms and procurement officials investigated for corruption by Italian enforcement authorities. We show that discretionary procedure auctions (those awarded based on negotiated rather than open bidding) are associated with corruption only when accompanied by limits to competition. We further show that, while these “corruptible” discretionary auctions are chosen more often by officials who are themselves investigated for corruption, they are used less often in procurement administrations in which at least one official is investigated for corruption. These findings fit with a framework in which more discretion leads to greater efficiency as well as more opportunities for theft, and a central monitor manages this trade-off by limiting discretion for high-corruption procedures and locales. Overall, our results suggest that competition may allow procurement authorities to extract the benefits of discretion while limiting the resultant risks of abuse.},

In this paper, we assess the long-term performance of different industrial policy instruments, which include production subsidies, investment subsidies, entry subsidies, and consolidation policies. To do so, we examine a recent industrial policy in China aiming to propel the country’s shipbuilding industry to the largest globally. Using ﬁrm-level data from 1998 to 2014 and a dynamic model of ﬁrm entry, exit, investment, and production, we ﬁnd that (i) the policy boosted China’s domestic investment, entry, and international market share dramatically, but delivered low returns and led to fragmentation, idle capacity, as well as depressed world ship prices; (ii) the effectiveness of different policy instruments is mixed: production and investment subsidies can be justiﬁed by market share considerations, while entry subsidies are wasteful; (iii) counter-cyclical policies, ﬁrm-targeting, and shortening the intervention horizon can substantially reduce distortions. Our results highlight the critical role of ﬁrm heterogeneity, business cycles, and ﬁrms’ cost structure in policy design. Finally, when exploring potential rationales, we ﬁnd support for non-classical considerations, such as reducing freight rates to boost Chinese trade.},

There are fears that because of general idiosyncrasies in the market for health care services, competition between hospitals will not generate efficient prices. These concerns have led to widespread calls for price regulation in the \$1.3 trillion hospital sector. A clear prediction from the growing literature on hospital insurer bargaining is that more appealing hospitals should be able to negotiate higher prices. Following this prediction, we introduce a simple test of the extent to which the market for hospital care in the US is functioning: analyzing whether high priced hospitals have higher quality, controlling for patient selection. We find that being admitted to a hospital with two standard deviations higher prices raises spending on patients by 53\% and lowers their mortality by 1 percentage point (37\%). However, the relationship between higher prices and lower mortality is only present at hospitals in less concentrated markets. Receiving care from expensive hospitals in concentrated markets increases spending but has no detectable effect on mortality.},

In particular, a model with learning and forgetting can give rise to aggressive pricing behavior, varying degrees of long-run industry concentration ranging from moderate leadership to absolute dominance, and multiple equilibria.},

The evaluation of such policies requires a reliable identiﬁcation procedure that is hardly achieved in empirical studies. We analyse the impact of a policy instrument – Law 488/92 (L488), the main Italian regional policy – that allocates subsidies to private ﬁrms by a multiple ranking system. Thanks to the peculiar L488 selection process that creates the conditions for a local random experiment, we are able to assess the effectiveness of these types of incentives for a relevant subgroup of ﬁrms. We propose a nonparametric multiple rankings regression discontinuity design that exploits the sharp discontinuities in the L488 rankings and extends the regression discontinuity design (RDD) approach to a context where the treatment is assigned by multiple rankings with different cut-off points. We ﬁnd that the impact of the subsidies on employment, investment, and turnover is positive and statistically signiﬁcant, while the effect on productivity is mostly negligible. The new subsidised capital is additional but non-complementary with the owner-ﬁnanced investment. The results are robust to different speciﬁcations and not due to intertemporal substitution.},

Most of the price decline after Proposition 209 resulted from the mix of subcontractors employed, which seems to arise from the higher costs of firms located in high-minority areas.

The null hypothesis is that Zurcher's decisions on bus engine replacement coincide with an optimal stopping rule: a strategy which specifies whether or not to replace the current bus engine each period as a function of observed and unobserved state variables. The optimal stopping rule is the solution to a stochastic dynamic programmingproblem that formalizes the trade-offbetween the conflicting objectives of minimizing maintenance costs versus minimizing unexpected engine failures. The model depends on unknown "primitive parameters" which specify Zurcher's expectations of the future values of the state variables, the expected costs of regular bus maintenance, and his perceptions of the customer goodwill costs of unexpected failures. Using ten years of monthly data on bus mileage and engine replacements for a subsample of 104 buses in the company fleet, I estimate these primitive parameters and test whether Zurcher's behavior is consistent with the model. Admittedly, few people are likely to take particular interest in Harold Zurcher and bus engine replacement per se. I focus on a specific individual and capital good because it provides a simple, concrete framework to illustrate two ideas: (i) a '"bottom-up"approach for modelling replacement investment, and (ii) a "nested fixed point" algorithm for estimating dynamic programming models of discrete choice.},

This paper estimates the benefits of such a strategy to Wal-Mart, focusing on the savings in distribution costs afforded by a dense network of stores. The paper takes a revealed preference approach, inferring the magnitude of density economies from how much sales cannibalization of closely packed stores Wal-Mart is willing to suffer to achieve density economies. The model is dynamic with rich geographic detail on the locations of stores and distribution centers. Given the enormous number of possible combinations of store-opening sequences, it is difficult to directly solve Wal-Mart's problem, making conventional approaches infeasible. The moment inequality approach is used instead and works well. The estimates show the benefits to Wal-Mart of high store density are substantial and likely extend significantly beyond savings in trucking costs.},

	abstract = {Traditional discrete-choice models assume buyers are aware of all products for sale. In markets where products change rapidly, the full information assumption is untenable. I present a discrete-choice model of limited consumer information, where advertising influences the set of products from which consumers choose to purchase. I apply the model to the U.S. personal computer market where top firms spend over \$2 billion annually on advertising. I find estimated markups of 19\% over production costs, where top firms advertise more than average and earn higher than average markups. High markups are explained to a large extent by informational asymmetries across consumers, where full information models predict markups of one-fourth the magnitude. I find that estimated product demand curves are biased toward being too elastic under traditional models. I show how to use data on media exposure to improve estimated price elasticities in the absence of micro ad data.},

	abstract = {The typical cost analysis of an environmental regulation consists of an engineering estimate of the compliance costs. In industries where fixed costs are an important determinant of market structure, this static analysis ignores the dynamic effects of the regulation on entry, investment, and market power. I evaluate the welfare costs of the 1990 Amendments to the Clean Air Act on the U.S. Portland cement industry, accounting for these effects through a dynamic model of oligopoly in the tradition of Ericson and Pakes (1995). Using the two-step estimator of Bajari, Benkard, and Levin (2007), I recover the entire cost structure of the industry, including the distributions of sunk entry costs and capacity adjustment costs. My primary finding is that the Amendments have significantly increased the sunk cost of entry, leading to a loss of between {\textbackslash}810M and {\textbackslash}3.2B in product market surplus. A static analysis misses the welfare penalty on consumers, and obtains the wrong sign of the welfare effects on incumbent firms.},

	abstract = {Climate policy by a coalition of countries can shift activities—extraction, production, and consumption—to regions outside the coalition. We build a general-equilibrium model of trade and carbon externalities to derive a coalition’s optimal Pareto-improving policy in such an environment. The policy can be implemented through: (i) a tax on fossil-fuel extraction at a rate equal to the global marginal harm from carbon emissions, (ii) a tax on imports of energy and goods, and a rebate of the tax on exports of energy but not goods, all at a lower rate per unit of carbon than the extraction tax rate, and (iii) a good-specific export subsidy. This combination of taxes and subsidies exploits international trade to expand the policy’s reach. It promotes energy efficient production and limits leakage by taxing the carbon content of imports of goods, by encouraging exports of goods, and by controlling the energy price in the non-taxing region by balancing supplyside and demand-side taxes. We use a quantitative version of the model to illustrate the gains achieved by the optimal policy and simpler variants. The optimal policy generates first-order welfare improvements over current and proposed climate policies.},

In the presence of common market failures—imperfect competition or choice frictions—the impact of such policies on market outcomes and welfare is ambiguous. We provide novel analysis of these forces in the context of a large-scale pharmaceutical price control policy in India. We find the policy lowered the prices of branded drugs by 24\% and increased their sales by 36\%, with minimal impact on entry, exit, and diffusion of new molecules. The standard revealed preference framework implies that the policy increased consumer surplus by 23\% because it corrected monopoly distortions without disrupting supply. However, we present novel evidence that choice frictions lead consumers to overvalue expensive brands relative to cheaper alternatives of similar quality. Once we account for these frictions, we find that the consumer surplus gains are 30\% smaller and that total welfare declines, as the policy unintentionally steers consumers toward costly overvalued brands. Finally, we assess how to effectively set price ceilings and evaluate alternative nonprice regulations.},

	abstract = {Investment in clean power depends on the price of internationally traded fossil fuels. To what extent can major fossil fuel exporters like the U.S. influence global electricity decarbonization through their trade policy? To answer this question, I develop and estimate a dynamic, multi-country model of power asset investment, where the carbon intensity of electricity generation is affected by the entry and exit of plants using alternative fuels and the local price of fossil inputs is determined in a global trade equilibrium. Using this model, I assess the climate impact of granting federal approval to all proposed U.S. liquified natural gas (LNG) export terminal projects, which would double U.S. export capacity by 2030. Results indicate a net decrease in global emissions through 2070, primarily due to higher local gas prices in the U.S., leading to lower domestic gas generation and accelerated renewable adoption. In the rest of the world, short-term emissions fall as reliance on coal drops, yet delayed renewable uptake drives long-term emissions up. Combining the LNG expansion with carbon policies in importing countries substantially boosts carbon savings. Conversely, reverting LNG capacity to baseline by 2050 shows little impact, underscoring the risk of carbon lock-in in settings with long-lived infrastructure.},

	abstract = {Regulators often impose trade restrictions in environmental permit markets, lowering gains from trade in order to redistribute value to groups that do not directly beneﬁt from permit trade, such as labor in harvesting ﬁrms. I evaluate the efﬁciency and distributional impacts of two common trade restrictions in Iceland’s ﬁsheries permit market: segmented trading by ﬁrm size and individual production requirements. Through a difference-in-differences analysis, I show that permit trade reallocates harvests to more productive boats, shifting income from lower- to higher-income workers and lowering aggregate labor intensity by 12\%, but that limits introduce inefﬁciencies: 15\% of boats bunch at mandated permit levels and permits for smaller boats are priced 30\% lower while targeting labor-intensive boats with lower average incomes. I develop a model of ﬁshery production and permit trading to simulate proﬁts, labor demand, and worker earnings in permit market equilibria without the restrictions. The analysis reveals distinct trade-offs: segmentation increases labor demand by 20 times more per dollar of foregone proﬁt than the production requirement, while the production requirement redistributes 14\% more income to low-income workers than segmentation per dollar foregone. Compared to the production requirement alone, implementing both restrictions achieves similar income redistribution per dollar while increasing labor demand sixfold.},

We build a spatial model that centers on the interaction of the market for (oceanic) transportation services and the market for world trade in goods. The model delivers equilibrium trade flows, as well as equilibrium trade costs (shipping prices). Using detailed data on vessel movements and shipping prices, we document novel facts about shipping patterns; we then flexibly estimate our model. We use this setup to demonstrate that the transportation sector (i) attenuates differences in the comparative advantage across countries; (ii) generates network effects in trade costs; and (iii) dampens the impact of shocks on trade flows. These three mechanisms reveal a new role for geography in international trade that was previously concealed by the frequently-used assumption of exogenous trade costs. Finally, we illustrate how our setup can be used for policy analysis by evaluating the impact of future and existing infrastructure projects (e.g., Northwest Passage, Panama Canal).},

In the basic Ricardian example, two countries do better by specializing in different goods and exchanging them for each other, even when one country is better at making both. This example typically gets presented in the first or second chapter of a text on international trade, and sometimes appears even in a principles text. But having served its pedagogical purpose, the model is rarely heard from again. The Ricardian model became something like a family heirloom, brought down from the attic to show a new generation of students, and then put back. Nearly two centuries later, however, the Ricardian framework has experienced a revival. Much work in international trade during the last decade has returned to the assumption that countries gain from trade because they have access to different technologies. These technologies may be generally available to producers in a country, as in the Ricardian model of trade, our topic here, or exclusive to individual firms. This line of thought has brought Ricardo's theory of comparative advantage back to center stage. Our goal is to make this new old trade theory accessible and to put it to work on some current issues in the international economy.},

Attempting to end widespread corruption, the government now requires sales to be conducted publicly, by either English or "two-stage" auctions. However, corruption persists through the choice of auction format and preauction side deals between favored bidders and local officials. Two-stage auctions have a first stage where favored developers signal that auctions are "taken," deterring entry of other bidders. Empirics show that both sales prices and competition are significantly less for two-stage than English auctions. Selection on unobserved property characteristics is positive: officials divert hotter properties to two-stage auctions.},

We assemble a comprehensive data set combining matched employer-employee data for the universe of formal ﬁrms in Brazil with the universe of federal government procurement contracts.

These effects also persist well beyond the length of the contracts. Part of this persistence comes from ﬁrms participating and wining more future auctions, as well as penetrating other markets.},

	abstract = {In the United States, 42\% of public infrastructure projects report delays or cost overruns. To mitigate this problem, regulators scrutinize project operations. We study the effect of oversight on delays and overruns with 262,857 projects spanning 71 federal agencies and 54,739 contractors. We identify our results using a federal bylaw: if the project’s budget is above a cutoff, procurement officers actively oversee the contractor’s operations; otherwise, most operational checks are waived. We find that oversight increases delays by 6.1\%–13.8\% and overruns by 1.4\%–1.6\%. We also show that oversight is most obstructive when the contractor has no experience in public projects, is paid with a fixed-fee contract with performance-based incentives, or performs a labor-intensive task. Oversight is least obstructive—or even beneficial—when the contractor is experienced, paid with a time-and-materials contract, or conducts a machine-intensive task.

We first develop a theoretical model to assess the micro-foundation of this approach in a water market context. The model distinguishes between variable and fixed costs of trade, which allows us to disentangle the decision to enter into the water market (extensive margin) and the decision on the quantity of water to be transferred (intensive margin). We then test the theoretical predictions using water transfer data among California water districts over a 17-year period. We approximate transfer costs by distance and institutional factors. Results validate the theoretical predictions and show the importance of distance and institutional impediments in the decision to trade.},

This shifted the arena for dispute resolution from courts to parliaments. It eliminated the seniority inherent in appropriative water rights and it sidelined issues of third-party impacts. Another difference was the tight control of irrigation institutions by state governments and the national government’s willingness to intervene in state and local water management. Australian water reform was wrapped in politics. When there were successes, this is because the politics were managed adroitly; when political challenges proved insurmountable, reform stalled.},

Many governments and payers use patient subsidies and provider incentives to increase the adoption of new health technologies. Using data from a randomized field experiment in Kenya, I estimate a structural model of patient demand and provider advice for a new contraceptive method. I then use the model to study the welfare effects to the patient from the introduction of demand and supply side incentives to adopt the new technology. This approach allows the study of channels that promote diffusion, including the roles of provider advice, financial incentives and altruism, as well as patient preferences. Taken together, the results suggest that changes in provider advice due to their altruism and financial incentives are key to increasing adoption of the new technology and making incentive programs effective, regardless of whether the incentive targets the patient or the provider. In fact, changes in provider advice account for 79\% of the welfare benefits of a policy that reduces the price to the patient. To be effective, incentive policies need to account for the central role that the provider takes in medical decision-making.},

Unlike stand-alone providers, integrated providers bear financial responsibility as insurers, which may incentivize them to limit resource-intensive services or better coordinate care. In the Massachusetts Individual Exchange, I find that integration reduces utilization, mainly by reducing patients’ visits to specialists. Integration lowers both the likelihood of patients visiting a specialist by 10 percentage points and, for those who do, the likelihood of seeking second opinions by 2.5 percentage points. This shift is accompanied by patients changing to new primary care practitioners (PCPs) who are more likely to be integrated with the insurer. To assess whether the reduction in specialist visits stems from integrated PCPs’ stricter gatekeeping or improved PCP-specialist coordination, I develop and estimate a physician referral model. Model estimates show that integrated PCPs are stricter in referral, but see more accurate information related to referral. Counterfactual analyses reveal that while most of the reduction in specialist visits is explained by gatekeeping, integration increases the likelihood of patients choosing a best-match specialist conditional on visiting a specialist.},

We focus on lenders that are vertically integrated (VI) with the investment bank structuring the CMBS. These lenders originate loans that have rate spreads that are 8.3 basis points lower and have 6.3 days, or 10\%, shorter time from origination to securitization, conditional on observables, relative to non-VI lenders. We introduce one mechanism for these results, which we call the “prioritization” channel, where we show that VI loans are prioritized over non-VI loans when constructing pools. This leads to shorter time to securitization, which gets passed through to lower rates. We also document a counteracting force where non-VI loans improve pool diversiﬁcation, which we call the “diversiﬁcation” incentive. We show that investors value diversiﬁcation, meaning that investors require lower yields on bonds backed by better diversiﬁed loan pools. To evaluate proposed policies limiting prioritization, such as implementation of an “ethical wall” policy that is prevalent in investment banking, we estimate a dynamic model of vertical integration in securitization and lending competition. We ﬁnd that removing prioritization shrinks the gap in rates by 67\%, decreases average loan rates by 1\%, increases overall loan origination by 10\%, and increases the frequency of securitization by 8\%. These results suggest that policies that limit prioritization would reduce warehousing risks of lenders, increase total loan origination, and decrease market concentration in CMBS lending.},

	abstract = {This paper integrates a randomized controlled trial and structural analysis to investigate how misconceptions about drug efficacy distort consumer decisions in the over-the-counter market and how clearer information can improve consumer welfare. A key challenge is that beliefs about efficacy are unobservable, which complicates the assessment of consumers’ initial perceptions and responses to new information. To address this, I gathered pairwise product comparisons from a control group and three treatment arms to develop product-level measures of efficacy beliefs. The first two treatments modify product labels to indicate whether drugs share the same active components or offer equivalent efficacy, while the third gives a brochure to consumers, prior to their purchase, that outlines both aspects. To document change in consumer choices in each information treatment, I first use control group data, supported by NielsenIQ data, to estimate a structural demand model that separately identifies the weight consumers place on beliefs about efficacy while accounting for heterogeneous preferences. I then incorporate the revised beliefs to document demand and supply responses to the information treatments. The results show that all treatments reduce information distortions and enhance welfare by increasing substitution between products with the same and different active components. The most effective treatment — emphasizing equivalent efficacy — increases substitution elasticities by 22\% on average, saves the average consumer \$1.09, and generates a welfare gain of \$1.20 per consumer. It results in \$6.5 million annual savings across the 50 largest markets. However, this approach also leads to second-degree price discrimination based on consumers’ preferences for symptom labels, highlighting the need for social planner to make informed policy decisions.},

These contracts can increase sales volumes by helping sellers establish a strong customer base across their product portfolios, but they also risk foreclosing competing sellers, even those oﬀering superior products. I examine the welfare implications of bundled loyalty discounts in the context of physicianadministered vaccines, which medical providers purchase and administer directly to their patients. I use prior antitrust cases involving vaccines to recover the proprietary terms of bundled discount contracts. I then develop a model of medical providers’ demand and pharmaceutical companies’ supply of vaccines. Using all-payer claims data from Colorado to estimate the model, I recover medical providers’ preferences, vaccines’ marginal costs, and the magnitude of bundled discounts that rationalizes providers’ observed purchasing patterns. I use the model to evaluate the equilibrium and welfare eﬀects of banning bundled discounts, allowing sellers and buyers to re-optimize their choices. I show that, in the absence of discounts, providers purchase fewer and lower-quality products, particularly at the expense of optional vaccines not required for school access. Insurers beneﬁt in the short term through lower immunization coverage costs. The eﬀect on pharmaceutical companies varies, depending on the scope and composition of their vaccine portfolios.},

Using a novel dataset, we document widespread use of exclusive dealing contracts that exclude local entry by rival stores. Public officials increasingly critique such practices as anti-competitive. At the same time, the extant literature on exclusive dealing has also shown that these contracts can stimulate entry into otherwise under-served markets. Descriptive analysis suggests that stores with exclusive dealing contracts face fewer competitors and higher prices. Yet, almost all major grocers in under-served neighborhoods have exclusive dealing contracts, suggesting they might encourage entry in low-demand settings. We use a structural approach to measure the counterfactual impact of a ban on exclusive dealing. We estimate a model of household-level store choices that accounts for price sensitivity, distance sensitivity, and potential complementarities across retailers. Upstream, we estimate a static entry game between retailers and landlords that accounts for downstream variable profits and information asymmetry between retailers and landlords. Results show that exclusive dealing benefits most landlords, large retailers, as well as households living in sparse retail environments. Furthermore, banning exclusive dealing would increase welfare for some households, but would cause an increase in the number of households living in food deserts and harm consumers living in these under-resourced areas.},

Methodologically, the contribution of this paper is to provide a method to estimate and solve entry games with multiple asymmetric firms, each making multiple discrete choices.

I quantify the effects of discriminatory production and consumption subsidies favoring US brands in the United States. I find that global product portfolio changes in response to these policies cause profit shifting towards US brands worldwide and that changes in consumer surplus vary greatly across markets due to heterogeneity in preferences.},

My analysis uses 20 years of administrative data from California, recording all licit handgun purchases in the state, the consumer and retailer in each transaction, and the universe of gun and non-gun fatalities. Isolating variation from the entry timing of firearm retailers in local markets, the presence of a first firearm retailer increases handgun purchases by 30 percent. The purchases on the margin of retailer entry are made by both repeat and first-time handgun purchasers, and these marginal handgun owners increase both homicide and suicide fatalities. To study the trade-off between consumer surplus and public health, I develop and estimate a model of consumer handgun purchase and its impact on fatalities. My estimates imply that handgun owners are adversely selected—those with a higher willingness to pay for a handgun also generate more expected fatalities—such that the expected public health costs of handgun ownership outweigh the private benefits of handgun purchase. Using the model to simulate counterfactual policies, California’s 2024 statewide sales tax on firearm purchase approximately maximizes tax revenues, but is too low when jointly accounting for consumer surplus and public health. More efficient policies target high tax rates to areas where marginal handgun purchasers have lower willingness to pay and higher expected fatalities. In particular, county-specific taxes could achieve a larger reduction in homicides and a smaller drop in consumer surplus by setting high tax rates around San Francisco and Los Angeles, while leaving the rest of the state at the status quo.},

Commonly cited frictions include incomplete property rights, costly management of externalities, and infrastructural constraints.

My model features agricultural production, urban demand, hydrological externalities, and bilateral transaction costs. I find that incomplete property rights and constraints on an important bottleneck in the system represent significant sources of friction. Despite qualitative concern about the regulatory burden of managing externalities, this friction is relatively modest. I estimate that constructing new infrastructure coupled with streamlining water rights management would quadruple trade volume, increase agricultural profits by 10\%, and increase environmental water supply.

We estimate a structural, hedonic model of households’ residential choices and visits to points of interest and find that households are willing to pay to avoid both car traffic on their street and travel time, but that these preferences vary widely across the population. Using the model and estimates of how traffic volumes affect road speeds, we simulate the traffic externalities caused by adding new residents in different locations. We find that a Massachusetts state law targeting a 10\% housing stock increase to land near public transit stops causes \$3.3 billion in traffic externalities from these new residents, an \$820 million reduction relative to spreading those homes uniformly across space. Building those units on thoroughfares instead would decrease welfare costs by an additional \$520 million.},

	abstract = {If a firm can make a credible announcement of its intent to enter a market, it may be able to deter rival firms from entering. We study procurement auctions conducted by Montana Department of Transportation, where a designated online Q\&A forum serves as an entry disclosure device. We specify and estimate a model of procurement auctions with costly entry, in which firms have the option to disclose entry during a period before the bids are submitted. We find that disclosure deters entry from other firms, but leads remaining entrants to bid more aggressively. Overall, disclosure is beneficial for a firm if they can disclose at an early period. The availability of disclosure device decreases the auctioneer’s payment by 6.3\%, while increasing the winner’s construction costs by 4.5\% and decreasing the total entry costs by 11.1\%.},

	abstract = {Innovations often combine several components to achieve outcomes greater than the “sum of the parts.” We argue that such combination innovations can introduce an understudied inefﬁciency—a positive market expansion externality that beneﬁts the owners of the components. We demonstrate the importance of this externality in the market for pharmaceutical cancer treatments, where drug combination therapies have proven highly effective. Using data on clinical trial investments, we document several facts consistent with inefﬁciently low private innovation: ﬁrms are less likely than publicly funded researchers to trial combinations, ﬁrms are less likely to trial combinations including other ﬁrms’ drugs than those including their own drugs, and ﬁrms often wait to trial combinations including other ﬁrms’ drugs until those drugs experience generic entry. Using microdata on drug prices and utilization, we quantify the externalities that arise from new combinations and ﬁnd that the market expansion externality often dominates the standard negative business stealing externality, suggesting too little innovation in combination therapies. As a result, ﬁrms may have incentives to free ride off others’ innovation, which we analyze with a dynamic structural model of innovation decisions. We use the model to design cost-effective policies that advance combination innovation. Redirecting publicly funded innovation toward combinations with high predicted market expansion or consumer surplus spillovers minimizes crowd out of private investments, increasing the rate of combination innovation and total welfare while remaining budget neutral.},

	abstract = {Catholic schools are the largest nongovernmental school network in the world, serving 62.2 million students globally. This paper uses Chilean data to assess the impact of Catholic versus secular voucher or public school attendance on student outcomes. I address admission selection bias by leveraging exogenous variation from school admission lotteries and controls for students’ probability of securing a seat in each type of school. My causal estimates reveal that students attending Catholic schools have a 17 percent higher probability of taking the college entry exam (CEE) than those who attend secular public schools. Additionally, Catholic school attendance raises students’ chances of scoring above the national mean by 33 percent in math and 45 percent in reading. Catholic school attendance also increases students’ probability of applying and being accepted to college. Nevertheless, attending Catholic schools raises dropout rates for boys with low baseline ability. Notably, the positive CEE effects are driven by girl students; however, attending a Catholic school appears to dissuade girls from pursuing STEM majors. Survey evidence reveals that Catholic schools have stricter disciplinary measures and foster higher levels of parent involvement than other public and secular institutions—characteristics commonly associated with high-achieving charter schools.},

To quantify these effects, I analyze Chile’s nitrate cartel in the early 20th Century, an industry that dominated Chile’s economy at the time. The results show that during cartel periods entry was higher (by 4 plants per year) and that these entrants had substantially lower productivity (by roughly one-third of the mean TFP). Leveraging a detailed knowledge of firms’ cost structure, I show that low barriers to entry reduced the profits of incumbent cartel members by 40\%. Moreover, a simulation of each firm’s entry decision indicates that, had prices been determined competitively, 25\% of the new plants would have postponed or canceled their entry to the industry.},

Greater access to larger buyers and more eﬃcient suppliers raises the marginal revenue product of labor and lowers the relative cost of intermediates to labor. This leads to higher wages in the presence of labor market power and lower labor shares when labor and materials are substitutes. Through counterfactual simulations of the estimated model we ﬁnd a substantial role for production networks in explaining the variances of earnings premia and labor shares across ﬁrms.},

Individuals are shielded against premium increases and coverage denial as long as they stay with their initial contract, but those that become higher risk are subject to premium increases or coverage denials upon switching, potentially leaving them locked-in with their original network of providers. I provide the ﬁrst empirical evidence on the importance of this phenomenon using administrative panel data from the universe of the private health insurance market in Chile, where competing insurers oﬀer long term contracts. I ﬁt a structural model to yearly plan choices, and am able to jointly estimate evolving preferences for diﬀerent insurance companies and supply-side underwriting in the form of premium risk-rating and coverage denial. To quantify the welfare eﬀects of lock-in, I compare simulated choices under the current rules to those in a counterfactual scenario with no underwriting. The results show that consumers would be willing to pay around 13 percent more in yearly premiums to avoid lock-in. Finally, I study a counterfactual scenario where long-term contracts are replaced with community-rated spot contracts, and I ﬁnd only minor general-equilibrium eﬀects on premiums and on the allocation of individuals across insurers. I argue that these small eﬀects are the result of large levels of preference heterogeneity uncorrelated to risk.},

	abstract = {We analyze the application process in the Chilean College Admissions problem. Students can submit up to 10 preferences, but most students do not ﬁll their entire application list (“short-list”). Even though students face no incentives to misreport, we ﬁnd evidence of strategic behavior as students tend to omit programs for which their admission probabilities are too low. To rationalize this behavior, we construct a portfolio problem where students maximize their expected utility given their preferences and beliefs over admission probabilities. We adapt the estimation procedure proposed by Agarwal and Somaini (2018) to solve a large portfolio problem. To simplify this task, we show that it is suﬃcient to compare a ROL with only a subset of ROLs (“one-shot swaps”) to ensure its optimality without running into the curse of dimensionality. To better identify the model, we exploit a unique exogenous variation on the admission weights over time. We ﬁnd that assuming truth-telling leads to biased results. Speciﬁcally, when students only include programs if it is strictly proﬁtable to do so, assuming truth-telling underestimates how preferred selective programs are and overstates the value of being unassigned and the degree of preference heterogeneity in the system. Ignoring the constraint on the length of the list can also result in biased estimates, even if the proportion of constrained ROLs is relatively small. Our estimation results strongly suggest that “short-list” students should not be interpreted as truth-tellers, even in a seemingly strategy-proof environment. Finally, we apply our estimation method to estimate students’ preferences for programs and majors in Chile and ﬁnd strong diﬀerences in preferences regarding students’ gender and scores.},

In practice, however, adverse selection can still arise on other dimensions. In 2020, in response to protests demanding gender equality, Chile banned gender-based pricing in its private health insurance market. I investigate how this policy impacts Chile’s health care system, which consists of a low-quality public option and a private market characterized by the use of GR contracts. I ﬁnd that, if the ban is implemented, prices in the private market would increase by more than 30\% as low-cost men switch to the public option and high-cost women enter. Overall, the regulation causes annual consumer surplus to increase \$373 per insured woman and decrease \$279 per insured man, which is around 2\% and 1\% of average annual per capita income, respectively. The ban is regressive, as high-income groups beneﬁt more than lowincome groups, creating a trade-oﬀ between gender-based equity and income-based equity. Subsidies that induce low-cost enrollees to remain in the private market are the most eﬀective mitigation strategy to contain higher premiums. Finally, relative to non-GR contracts, the number of individuals choosing the private market is lower under guaranteed renewability.},

A key challenge in dynamic demand models is the fact that consumers form expectations about the future evolution of product characteristics and base their choices on them. Using a new methodology, based on a combination of revealed preference inequalities and latent variable integration, this work takes these expectations into account without having to model them explicitly, while using exclusion restrictions to separate switching costs from unobserved preference heterogeneity.

	abstract = {Previous research has documented an “annuity puzzle”, the empirical regularity that retirees hold too small a fraction of wealth in annuities. To understand the role of pension system design in creating this puzzle, we study Chile’s pension system, where the annuitization rate is over 70\%. By estimating retiree preferences for retirement assets and the cost of annuitization, we show that Chile’s exception to the annuity puzzle is driven by the lack of a mandatory social insurance component and by restrictions on lump sum withdrawals. Reforming these rules would lower annuitization rates and average welfare, but would increase welfare for those at the highest levels of longevity risk. We establish that different coverage levels for mandatory insurance induce a trade-off between providing protection for longevity risk and average welfare, and provide guidance for policy makers seeking to reform the rules governing how retirees can access their retirement savings.},

We study vintage-speciﬁc restrictions, which place heavy limits on older, polluting vehicles and no limits on newer, cleaner ones. We use a novel model of the car market and results from Santiago’s 1992 program, the earliest program to use vintage-speciﬁc restrictions, to show that such restrictions should be designed to work exclusively through the extensive margin (type of car driven), never through the intensive margin (number of miles driven). If so, vintage restrictions can yield important welfare gains by moving the ﬂeet composition toward cleaner cars, comparing well to alternative instruments such as scrappage subsidies and pollution-based registration fees.},

	abstract = {In the presence of high employment informality, public pension systems are dysfunctional: they provide little average retirement protection, and the protection is unequally given; concentrated on high-income households. In this paper, I study theoretically and empirically how high informality inﬂuences the optimal design of public pensions on its two core attributes: the pension contribution rate and the relationship between lifetime formal earnings and beneﬁts. I start with a novel framework that gauges the welfare eﬀects of reforms to these attributes, which are characterized by the trade-oﬀ between social insurance and eﬃciency. Employing Chilean administrative data merged with a panel survey and two quasi-experimental variations on the pension system design, I empirically estimate this trade-oﬀ. On the one hand, I ﬁnd that increasing the beneﬁts of workers with low lifetime earnings –by ﬂattening the earnings-beneﬁt link– improves the social insurance provided by the system because these workers are the most vulnerable and the least protected; reducing their consumption upon retirement thrice as much as that of high earners. On the other hand, I ﬁnd that ﬂattening the earnings-beneﬁt link generates signiﬁcant eﬃciency costs by distorting workers’ formal earnings and their private savings for retirement. However, the trade-oﬀ weighs in favor of more progressive beneﬁts, and there are large social gains in transferring retirement income from high to low earners through a ﬂattening of the earnings-beneﬁt link.},

In the context of Medicare Advantage, I ﬁnd that consumers’ information is limited, and quality is ineﬃciently low. A simple design alleviates these issues and increases total welfare by 3.7 monthly premiums. More than half of the gains stem from scores’ eﬀect on quality rather than information. Scores can outperform full-information outcomes by regulating ineﬃcient oligopolistic quality provision, and a binary certiﬁcation of quality attains 98\% of this welfare. Scores are informative even when coarse; ﬁrms’ incentives are to produce quality at the scoring threshold, which consumers know. The primary design challenge of scores is to dictate thresholds and thus regulate quality.},

The effect is not explained by a change in patient composition and is robust to several alternative explanations. Instead, we provide suggestive evidence that the reform led to more efficient use of medical resources and improved personnel practices.

We develop and test a personalized information provision intervention that targets families of public Pre-K students entering elementary schools in Chile. Using a randomized control trial, we ﬁnd that the intervention shifts parents’ choices toward schools with higher average test scores, higher value added, higher prices, and schools that tend to be further from their homes. Tracking students with administrative data, we ﬁnd that student academic achievement on test scores was approximately 0.2 standard deviations higher among treated families ﬁve years after the intervention. To quantitatively gauge how average treatment effects might vary in a scaled up version of this policy, we embed the randomized control trial within a structural model of school choice and competition where price and quality are chosen endogenously and schools face capacity constraints. We use the estimated model of demand and supply to simulate policy effects under different assumptions about equilibrium constraints. In counterfactual simulations, we ﬁnd that capacity constraints play an important role mitigating the policy effect but in several scenarios, the supply-side response increases quality, which contributes to an overall positive average treatment effect. Finally, we show how the estimated model can inform the design of a large scale experiment such that reduced form estimates can capture equilibrium effects and spillovers.},

We combine ﬁve decades of data on parents and children in Chile with a regression discontinuity design to show that, in the long run, elite colleges in fact do both. When lower-status individuals gain admission to elite college degree programs, they transform their children’s social environment. Children become 21\% more likely to attend high-status private schools and 8\% more likely to attend an elite college. They live near and are more likely to befriend high-status peers. In contrast, parent elite admission does not improve children’s academic performance in high school or on college admissions exams. Parents’ social and marriage-market exposure to high-status peers, rather than high-achieving peers, are key mediators of eﬀects for children. Simulations combining descriptive and quasi-experimental results highlight how elite colleges simultaneously tighten the link between social capital and human capital and increase the persistence of elite social capital across generations. Plausible shifts in admission policies can produce substantial movement along this mobility-meritocracy frontier.},

However, the lack of quasi-experimental evidence has limited these estimates, hindering policy assessments. This paper addresses this gap by leveraging Chile’s 2011 Subsidio Habitacional program and administrative data on property transactions from 1998 to 2020. The results imply a housing supply elasticity of 0.543, indicating low responsiveness of the housing supply. In particular, the response of new construction is twice as large as the conversion of rental units into owner-occupied housing, suggesting that supply constraints and low elasticity persist in non-CBD areas, where construction activity is relatively low. Finally, we estimate that the policy increased housing prices by an average of 8.87\% in its first 10 years, with substantial variation across neighborhoods. We conclude that subsidizing housing for low- and middleincome households may not be an effective solution to the affordability crisis and may disproportionately benefit developers.},

In this paper, we explore one potential mechanism for this effect: that homeownership and housing stability, more generally, could increase human capital formation in children. We study a large, novel housing policy – a homebuyer subsidy for low-income families in Santiago, Chile. We leverage an arbitrary discontinuity in subsidy assignment to estimate the causal impacts of homeownership on a wide array of primary, secondary, and tertiary education outcomes for children. We find that children in marginally eligible families significantly improve their attendance, grades, class ranks, and achievement test scores relative to children in families that narrowly miss the cutoff. The gains are larger for boys than girls and are no different between younger and older children. Our findings are not driven by sorting into different schools or changes in neighborhood quality. The gains are more pronounced for children in larger families, suggesting that alleviating overcrowded living conditions is an important mediator of the program’s effects. Subsidy-winning parents reduce their labor market participation, are more actively involved in their children’s schooling, and have higher educational aspirations for them. We find that, early in life, the subsidy increases children’s preschool attendance, and later in life, children graduate high school and attend college at higher rates. Those who have left school also have higher employment rates. In all, we find that homebuyer subsidies are a promising tool for improving the economic fortunes of children from vulnerable families.},

            Many school districts with centralized school choice adopt strategy-proof assignment mechanisms to relieve applicants from needing to strategize based on beliefs about their own admissions chances. This article shows that beliefs about admissions chances shape choice outcomes even when the assignment mechanism is strategy-proof by influencing how applicants search for schools and that “smart matching platforms” that provide live feedback on admissions chances help applicants search more effectively. Motivated by a model in which applicants engage in costly search for schools and overoptimism can lead to undersearch, we use data from a large-scale survey of choice participants in Chile to show that learning about schools is hard, beliefs about admissions chances guide the decision to stop searching, and applicants systematically underestimate nonplacement risk. We use RCT and RD research designs to evaluate scaled live feedback policies in the Chilean and New Haven choice systems. Twenty-two percent of applicants submitting applications where risks of nonplacement are high respond to warnings by adding schools to their lists, reducing nonplacement risk by 58\% and increasing test score value added at the schools where they enroll by 0.10 standard deviations. Reducing the burden of school choice requires not just strategy-proofness inside the centralized system but also choice supports for the strategic decisions that inevitably remain outside of it.},

This paper studies nonparametric identifiability of type probabilities and type-specific component distributions in finite mixture models of dynamic discrete choices. We derive sufficient conditions for nonparametric identification for various finite mixture models of dynamic discrete choices used in applied work under different assumptions on the Markov property, stationarity, and type-invariance in the transition process. Three elements emerge as the important determinants of identification: the time-dimension of panel data, the number of values the covariates can take, and the heterogeneity of the response of different types to changes in the covariates. For example, in a simple case where the transition function is type-invariant, a time-dimension of T = 3 is sufficient for identification, provided that the number of values the covariates can take is no smaller than the number of types and that the changes in the covariates induce sufficiently heterogeneous variations in the choice probabilities across types. Identification is achieved even when state dependence is present if a model is stationary first-order Markovian and the panel has a moderate time-dimension (T 6).},

Second, much of the apparent willingness to pay for more educated and wealthier neighbors is explained by the correlation of these sociodemographic measures with unobserved neighborhood quality. Third, neighborhood race is not capitalized directly into housing prices; instead, the negative correlation of neighborhood percent black and housing prices is due entirely to the fact that blacks live in unobservably lower‐quality neighborhoods. Finally, there is considerable heterogeneity in preferences for schools and neighbors, with households preferring to self‐segregate on the basis of both race and education.},

Our model nests standard specifications featuring rich observed and unobserved consumer heterogeneity as well as product/market-level unobservables that introduce the problem of econometric endogeneity. Previous work establishes identification of such models using market-level data and instruments for all prices and quantities. Micro data provides a panel structure that facilitates richer demand specifications and reduces requirements on both the number and types of instrumental variables. We address identification of demand in the standard case in which nonprice product characteristics are assumed exogenous, but also cover identification of demand elasticities and other key features when these product characteristics are endogenous and not instrumented. We discuss implications of these results for applied work.},

	abstract = {This paper shows the endogeneity of amenities plays a crucial role in determining the welfare distribution of a city’s residents. We quantify this mechanism by building a dynamic model of residential choice with heterogeneous households, where consumption amenities are the equilibrium outcome of a market for non-tradables. We estimate our model using Dutch microdata and leveraging variation in Amsterdam’s spatial distribution of tourists as a demand shifter, finding significant heterogeneity in residents’ preferences over amenities and in the supply responses of amenities to changes in demand composition. This two-way heterogeneity dictates the degree of horizontal differentiation across neighborhoods, residential sorting, and inequality. Finally, we show the distributional effects of mass tourism depend on this heterogeneity: following rent increases due to growing tourist demand for housing, younger residents—whose amenity preferences are closest to tourists—are compensated by amenities tilting in their favor, while the losses of older residents are amplified.},

The network was designed to connect provincial capitals and cities with an urban population above 500,000. As a side effect, a large number of small peripheral counties were connected to large metropolitan agglomerations. To address non-random route placements on the way between targeted city nodes, I propose an instrumental variable strategy based on the construction of least cost path spanning tree networks. The estimation results suggest that network connections have led to a reduction in GDP growth among non-targeted peripheral counties.

            This article examines the historical impact of railroads on the U.S. economy, with a focus on quantifying the aggregate impact on the agricultural sector in 1890. Expansion of the railroad network may have affected all counties directly or indirectly—an econometric challenge that arises in many empirical settings. However, the total impact on each county is captured by changes in that county’s “market access,” a reduced-form expression derived from general equilibrium trade theory. We measure counties’ market access by constructing a network database of railroads and waterways and calculating lowest-cost county-to-county freight routes. We estimate that county agricultural land values increased substantially with increases in county market access, as the railroad network expanded from 1870 to 1890. Removing all railroads in 1890 is estimated to decrease the total value of U.S. agricultural land by 60\%, with limited potential for mitigating these losses through feasible extensions to the canal network or improvements to country roads.},

	abstract = {Cities are divided into local governments responsible for local commuting infrastructure that is used by both their residents and outsiders. This paper examines how metropolitan fragmentation impacts the provision of commuting infrastructure and the spatial distribution of economic activity. I develop a quantitative spatial model in which municipalities compete for residents and workers by investing in commuting infrastructure to maximize net land value within their jurisdictions. In equilibrium, relative to a metropolitan planner, municipalities underinvest in areas near their boundaries and overinvest in areas away from the boundary. Central municipalities tend to underinvest more, as higher commuting costs encourage households to move closer to where they work, thereby increasing land values in central areas. Infrastructure investment in fragmented cities results in higher cross-jurisdiction commuting costs, more dispersed employment, and more polycentric patterns of economic activity. Estimating the model using data from Santiago, Chile, I find substantial gains from centralizing investment decisions. Centralization allocates infrastructure more efficiently and increases aggregate expenditure on infrastructure.},

Our approach yields analytical expressions for transportation costs between any two locations, the traffic along each link of the transportation network, and the equilibrium distribution of economic activity across the economy, each as a function of the underlying quality of infrastructure and the strength of traffic congestion. We characterize the properties of such an equilibrium and show how the framework can be combined with traffic data to evaluate the impact of improving any segment of the infrastructure network. Applying our framework to both the US highway network and the Seattle road network, we find highly variable returns to investment across different links in the respective transportation networks, highlighting the importance of well-targeted infrastructure investment.},

We find changes in work locations and wages consistent with a reduction in firms’ labor market power around areas connected to the subway network after the expansion. We then lay out a quantitative spatial equilibrium model where firms behave as oligopsonies in the labor market to calculate the welfare gains from the transit infrastructure expansion. Our model allows us to decompose the welfare gains into i) the efficiency gains through improved matching between workers and firms and ii) the gains from reducing labor misallocation through labor market power responses. The model also provides a framework to analyze the distributional implications of the infrastructure expansion.

But how do firms choose which technologies to develop? Do they ever fail to exploit new technological paradigms? I build a new model of innovation and firm dynamics to study a novel link between market structure, the direction of innovation, and economic growth: Expertise in a current technology gives incumbents a comparative advantage at innovating it relative to entrants, who instead favor a new technology with higher growth potential. Each firm’s innovation decisions influence others through knowledge spillovers, so the initial market structure can affect the long-run direction of innovation. Concentrating R\&D resources in a small number of firms allows faster accumulation of expertise. This raises growth when all firms innovate the same technology. But it can lower growth when firms face a technology choice, amplifying the influence of incumbents and potentially delaying or preventing the emergence of the new technology. I provide empirical evidence for the theory using data on firm patenting and R\&D expenditures. I also show that it explains the historical development of mRNA vaccines, and I explore its implications for the highly concentrated innovation of artificial intelligence.},

            We develop a general equilibrium framework to determine the spatial distribution of economic activity on any surface with (nearly) any geography. Combining the gravity structure of trade with labor mobility, we provide conditions for the existence, uniqueness, and stability of a spatial economic equilibrium and derive a simple set of equations that govern the relationship between economic activity and the geography of the surface. We then use the framework to estimate the topography of trade costs, productivities and amenities in the United States. We find that geographic location accounts for at least twenty percent of the spatial variation in U.S. income. Finally, we calculate that the construction of the interstate highway system increased welfare by 1.1 to 1.4 percent, which is substantially larger than its cost.},

Counterfactual analysis shows that implementing simple tariff pricing changes can enhance allocative efﬁciency and expand the market, offering daily consumer surplus gains of up to \$227 thousand and up to 49 thousand additional daily taxi-passenger matches, a similar magnitude to the gain in matches generated by adopting a perfect static matching technology.},

	abstract = {This paper introduces a method to study the impact of policy events on equilibrium selection in settings where strong complementarities may lead to multiple equilibria and coordination failures. Many industrial policies are rooted in the idea of coordination failures and ‘big-push’ theories, yet empirical evidence on their effectiveness remains limited as distinguishing equilibrium shifts from direct changes in fundamentals is challenging. Leveraging tools from industrial organization and algebraic geometry, I develop an approach that enables the study of coordination effects without imposing strong assumptions on the distribution or responsiveness of economic fundamentals. The method identifies the underlying ‘types’ of all factual and counterfactual equilibria through a three-step procedure: model estimation and inversion, equilibrium enumeration, and type assignment. Types of the factual equilibria may then used as outcomes to study how events, such as urban infrastructure or trade liberalization episodes, affect equilibrium selection. Types of counterfactual equilibria further allow decomposition of observed effects on equilibrium outcomes into those due to fundamentals versus coordination. I apply this method to study industrial zones in India. Using a newly assembled dataset, I find that municipalities receiving an industrial zone see a 60\% increase in non-farm employment over 15 years, with significant spillovers to non-targeted sectors and municipalities. Combining the methodology developed in the paper with event study designs, I find that industrial zones increase the probability of escaping a low-industrialization equilibrium by 38\%. Coordination effects explain approximately one third of the observed change in outcomes. This method can also be broadly applied to analyze the role of complementarities and coordination in areas such as urban infrastructure, city structure, trade liberalization, and technology adoption.},

I simulate counterfactuals to assess the global impact of China tightening its recent internet restrictions on crossborder OSS collaboration or increasing its financial support for domestic OSS. I find that stricter restrictions do little to boost domestic OSS investment. Instead, lost spillovers raise web development costs in China by \$2 per dollar of disincentive and \$7 globally.

	abstract = {Interoperability—the ability of different systems to work together—is an increasingly vital component of product markets. We study the impact of interoperability frictions in the context of US hospital Electronic Health Record (EHR) systems. While use of EHR systems is widespread, interoperability of these systems remains low, particularly across those produced by different EHR vendors. We examine how interoperability affects patients by considering both a direct, technological effect of inﬂuencing health information exchange and an allocative effect of shifting the ﬂow of patients across providers. Using an event study design in which interoperability between hospital pairs changes when one changes EHR vendors, we ﬁnd evidence for both channels. When two hospitals switch to having the same EHR vendor, charges and readmissions rates for patients who are transferred and referred between them decrease by 4\% and 11\%, respectively. In addition, these hospitals now share 8\% more inpatient transfers and 9-10\% more referrals. This change in patient ﬂows further affects patient outcomes: patient health improves when their sending hospitals switch to EHR vendors used by higher-quality hospitals in the market and worsens when the opposite occurs. To quantify the welfare gain from reducing interoperability frictions, we estimate a demand model of how patients and providers trade-off interoperability with other receiving hospital characteristics when choosing where to send patients. The model is identiﬁed by changes in patient ﬂows following changes in hospital EHR vendors and interoperability levels. We show that eliminating all interoperability frictions would redirect 7.5\% of patients to different hospitals and increase joint hospital-patient welfare by 21\%, the equivalent of a 57-kilometer reduction in travel distance.},

It does so by estimating and solving, using parametric approximations to firms' value functions, a dynamic model that captures important features of the industry such as vertical and horizontal product differentiation, demographic variation in programming tastes, and multi-station ownership. The estimated model predicts that high fees would cause the number of music stations to fall significantly and quite quickly. For example, a fee equal to 10\% of revenues would cause a 4.6\% drop in the number of music stations within 2 1/2 years, and a 9.4\% drop in the long run. The size of the change is limited, however, by the fact that many listeners, particularly in demographics that are valued by advertisers, have strong preferences for music programming.},

            We characterize how firms select between alternative ways of serving a market. “First-order” selection effects, whether firms enter or not, are extremely robust. “Second-order” ones, how firms serve a market conditional on entry, are much less so: more efficient firms select the entry mode with lower market-access costs if firms’ maximum profits are supermodular in production and market-access costs, but not necessarily otherwise. We derive microfoundations for supermodularity in a range of canonical models. Notable exceptions include horizontal and vertical FDI with “subconvex” demands (i.e., less convex than CES), fixed costs that increase with productivity, and R\&D with threshold effects.},

The staggered liberalization of access to foreign capital across disaggregated industries allows us to identify changes in firms' input wedges, overcoming major challenges in the measurement of the effects of changing misallocation. Liberalization increases capital overall. For domestic firms with initially high marginal revenue products of capital (MRPK), liberalization increases revenues by 23\%, physical capital by 53\%, wage bills by 28\%, and reduces MRPK by 33\% relative to low MRPK firms. The effects of liberalization are largest in areas with less developed local banking sectors, indicating that inefficiencies in that sector may cause misallocation. Finally, we propose an assumption under which a novel method exploiting natural experiments can be used to bound the effect of changes in misallocation on treated industries' aggregate productivity. These industries' Solow residual increases by 3–16\%.},

Our benchmark results point towards significant and heterogeneous economies of scale across manufacturing sectors, but only modest gains from industrial policy, below 1\% of GDP on average.

We illustrate some implications for the case where the research design takes advantage of variation across units (say, US states) in exposure to some treatment (say, a policy change). In this case, the TWFE can fail to estimate the average (or even a weighted average) of the units’ coefficients. Under some conditions, there exists no estimator that is guaranteed to estimate even a weighted average. Building on the literature, we note that when there is a unit totally unaffected by treatment, it is possible to estimate an average effect by replacing the TWFE with an average of difference-in-differences estimators.},

	abstract = {While the mechanism design paradigm emphasizes notions of efficiency based on agent preferences, policymakers often focus on alternative objectives. School districts emphasize educational achievement, and transplantation communities focus on patient survival. It is unclear whether choice-based mechanisms perform well when assessed based on these outcomes. This paper evaluates the assignment mechanism for allocating deceased donor kidneys on the basis of patient life-years from transplantation (LYFT). We examine the role of choice in increasing LYFT and compare equilibrium assignments to benchmarks that remove choice. Our model combines choices and outcomes in order to study how selection affects LYFT. We show how to identify and estimate the model using instruments derived from the mechanism. The estimates suggest that the design in use selects patients with better post-transplant survival prospects and matches them well, resulting in an average LYFT of 8.78, which is 0.92 years more than a random assignment. However, the maximum aggregate LYFT is 13.84. Realizing the majority of the gains requires transplanting relatively healthy patients, who would have longer life expectancies even without a transplant. Therefore, a policymaker faces a dilemma between transplanting patients who are sicker and those for whom life will be extended the longest.},

Mortality rates in patient discharge records are widely used to infer hospital quality. However, hospital admission is not random and some hospitals may attract patients with greater unobserved severity of illness than others. In this situation the assumption of random admission leads to spurious inference about hospital quality. This study controls for hospital selection using a model in which distance between the patient's residence and alternative hospitals are key exogenous variables. Bayesian inference in this model is feasible using a Markov chain Monte Carlo posterior simulator, and attaches posterior probabilities to quality comparisons between individual hospitals and groups of hospitals. The study uses data on 74,848 Medicare patients admitted to 114 hospitals in Los Angeles County from 1989 through 1992 with a diagnosis of pneumonia. It finds the smallest and largest hospitals to be of the highest quality. There is strong evidence of dependence between the unobserved severity of illness and the assignment of patients to hospitals, whereby patients with a high unobserved severity of illness are disproportionately admitted to high quality hospitals. Consequently a conventional probit model leads to inferences about quality that are markedly different from those in this study's selection model.},

Using about 265,000 sequences of a game of alternating-offer bargaining following an ascending auction in the wholesale used-car industry, this study estimates (or bounds) distributions of buyer and seller values and evaluates where realized bargaining outcomes lie relative to efﬁcient outcomes. Results demonstrate that the ex-ante and ex-post efﬁcient outcomes are close to one another, but that the real bargaining falls short of both, suggesting that the bargaining is indeed inefﬁcient but that this inefﬁciency is not solely due to the information constraints highlighted in Myerson and Satterthwaite (1983).

	abstract = {This paper uses a ﬁrm-to-ﬁrm transaction dataset to evaluate quantitatively how shocks propagate through production networks when their underlying links are costly to form and adjust. I document a set of facts consistent with adjustment frictions in these relationships. In particular, these links react sluggishly to ﬁrm-speciﬁc international trade shocks and are unresponsive to small shocks but strongly responsive to large shocks. Guided by these facts, I develop a dynamic general equilibrium model with endogenous production networks where links have adjustment frictions. Solving for the links’ dynamics with a large number of ﬁrms is made possible by leveraging the empirical sparsity of ﬁrm-to-ﬁrm links. To measure the aggregate relevance of these adjustment frictions, I estimate the model using a simulated method of moments and evaluate how international trade shocks during the Great Recession propagated in Chile. Without links’ adjustment frictions, and thus with a totally ﬂexible network, the output losses from these shocks would have been 30 percent lower. The application highlights the relevance that dynamics in ﬁrm-to-ﬁrm links has not only for ﬁrms’ connectivity but also for how aggregate output responds to shocks.},

	abstract = {The average price of cement in Africa was the highest of any continent in 2011, but by 2017 had fallen by 34.6 percent, the largest decline in the world, according to data from the International Comparison Program. An empirical industry equilibrium model distinguishes between the fundamental drivers of differences in prices across countries: demand elasticity, costs, conduct, and entry. The model reveals that in 2011 average prices in Africa included the highest mark-ups and marginal costs in the world. The price decline in 2017 is accounted for by a rapid increase in the number of firms producing cement, which lowered mark-ups, and a declining marginal cost of production. Improvements in the quality of infrastructure or institutions could explain declining marginal costs, as could new technology installed by new entrants. Estimated fixed costs of entry are positive, though not systematically higher in Africa compared to other continents, suggesting equally free entry in the presence of a minimum efficient scale that does not vary across continents. These results suggest that the small size of national markets rather than regulation of entry explains why the price of cement was so high in Africa. As the market has grown, prices have fallen.},

This paper uses new micro-data on key input prices in the construction sector and market structure at a global level to study distortions in construction sector inputs and their consequences. We document that (i) there is large dispersion in construction sector input prices and that cement prices are particularly high in the poorest countries; (ii) cement prices are highest in countries with few firms; (iii) cement plays a significant role in construction sector expenditures, particularly in the poorest countries. To understand the reasons for price differences in cement we estimate a model of oligopoly using both a demand-based instrument and exploiting geological variation in the dispersion of limestone deposits within countries. Our results suggest that lower levels of competition lead to significantly higher prices. Firm-level financial accounts data point toward substantial economic rents. We then embed the oligopoly structure into a dynamic general equilibrium network model to analyse the consequences of distortions on the wider economy. We find that due to cement's network position, distortions have large effects on steady-state output: for every dollar increase in cement profits, steady-state output falls by two. Finally, we find that common ownership in cement is an important source of distortions accounting for between 75\% and 85\% of the wedge due to markups in cement.},

I develop an equilibrium model of school competition and student sorting under social interactions. In the model, families differ by human capital and income. Academic achievement depends on own characteristics, school productivity, and the characteristics of the peers. Geographic differentiation gives schools local market power to increase prices and decrease quality in the absence of close substitutes. On top of that, social interactions generate interdependencies in demand that add a new dimension for school differentiation. This modiﬁes school incentives through two channels: it strengthens market power for some schools (direct channel) and it incentivizes a screening strategy that exploits heterogeneous responses to prices and quality to intensify differentiation (strategic channel). To study the empirical importance of these mechanisms, I estimate the model using administrative microdata from Peru. I address endogeneity of prices, quality, and peers by combining a regression discontinuity in the assignment of a scholarship with instruments that exploit the timing and local variation of a generous teacher payment reform and shocks to student sorting generated by a teachers’ strike. I ﬁnd that social interactions have sizable effects, increasing the income gap in academic achievement by 30 percentage points I use the predictions of the model to analyze the effects of counterfactual education policies in equilibrium. I then decompose the mechanisms to provide guidance on how to design education policies that improve the distribution of outcomes.},

            This paper develops a general theory of aggregation in inefficient economies. We provide nonparametric formulas for aggregating microeconomic shocks in economies with distortions such as taxes, markups, frictions to resource reallocation, financial frictions, and nominal rigidities. We allow for arbitrary elasticities of substitution, returns to scale, factor mobility, and input-output network linkages. We show how to separately measure changes in technical and allocative efficiency. We also show how to compute the social cost of distortions. We pursue applications focusing on firm-level markups in the United States. We find that improvement in allocative efficiency, due to the reallocation over time of market share to high-markup firms, accounts for about half of aggregate TFP growth over the period 1997–2015. We also find that eliminating the misallocation resulting from the large and dispersed markups estimated in the data would raise aggregate TFP by about 15\%, increasing the economy-wide cost of monopoly distortions by two orders of magnitude compared with the famous 0.1\% estimate by Harberger (1954). These exact numbers should be interpreted with care because the data are imperfect and require substantial imputation.},

	abstract = {The Women, Infants, and Children nutritional program (WIC) serves as an intermediary in the infant formula market, providing vouchers to its participants – lowincome mothers and their infants – and allowing them to obtain specific brands of infant formula for free. To determine these brands, each state’s WIC agency exclusively contracts with a single manufacturer in exchange for rebates and an agreement to abide by pricing regulations. I quantify the effect of this purchasing program on consumer surplus and government expenditure; and explore an alternative approach to subsidize WIC participants by giving them a discount on any brand. I do this by estimating a demand model where preferences and prices paid vary across WIC and non-WIC participants, and a supply model where the contract manufacturer faces price regulations. I find that removing the WIC program, in a lassize-faire counterfactual, raises prices. This is because price regulation forces the contract manufacturer to set a lower price which strengthens competition. Though the current WIC purchasing process yields a higher aggregate consumer surplus than an alternative discount coupon policy, it also increases the WIC program’s expenditures and reduces the total welfare of the market.},

	abstract = {Using rich data on hourly physical productivity and thousands of ownership changes from US power plants, we study the effects of acquisitions on efficiency and underlying mechanisms. We find a 2\% average increase in efficiency for acquired plants, beginning five months after acquisitions. Efficiency gains rise to 5\% under direct ownership changes, with no significant change when only parent ownership changes. Investigating the mechanisms, three-quarters of the efficiency gain is attributed to increased productive efficiency, while the rest comes from dynamic efficiency through changes in production allocation. Our evidence suggests that highproductivity firms buy underperforming assets from low-productivity firms and make them as productive as their existing assets through operational improvements. Finally, acquired plants improve their performance beyond efficiency by increasing output and reducing outages.},

	abstract = {Demand estimates are essential for addressing a wide range of positive and normative questions in economics that are known to depend on the shape—and notably the curvature—of the true demand functions. The existing frontier approaches, while allowing flexible substitution patterns, typically require the researcher to commit to a parametric specification. An open question is whether these a priori restrictions are likely to significantly affect the results. To address this, I develop a nonparametric approach to estimation of demand for differentiated products, which I then apply to California supermarket data. While the approach subsumes workhorse models such as mixed logit, it allows consumer behaviors and preferences beyond standard discrete choice, including continuous choices, complementarities across goods, and consumer inattention. When considering a tax on one good, the nonparametric approach predicts a much lower pass‐through than a standard mixed logit model. However, when assessing the market power of a multiproduct firm relative to that of a single‐product firm, the models give similar results. I also illustrate how the nonparametric approach may be used to guide the choice among parametric specifications.},

These models are rich enough to speak to ﬁrst-order features of the data, such as many heterogeneous locations and gravity equation relationships for trade and commuting. At the same time, these models are sufﬁciently tractable to undertake realistic counterfactual exercises to study the effect of changes in amenities, productivity, and public policy interventions such as transport infrastructure investments. We provide an extensive taxonomy of the different building blocks of these quantitative spatial models and discuss their main properties and quantiﬁcation.},

When the initial cost of offshoring is high, an increase in offshoring opportunities causes a fall in the real wages of unskilled workers in industrial countries, skill-biased technical change and rising skill premia. When the offshoring cost is sufficiently low, instead, offshoring induces technical change biased in favor of the unskilled workers. (JEL J24, J31, L24, O33)},

The second is data on the specific predictions of the government agencies about the market post-merger. A key point of this article is to stress how weak an analysis of only the first type of data is. The frequent call for retrospective studies typically envisions relying on just this type of data, but the limitations on the analysis are not well understood. As I explain below, retrospective studies that ask whether prices went up post merger are surprisingly poor guides for analyzing merger policy. It is only when the second type of data is combined with the first type that a reliable analysis of antitrust policy can be carried out. There is a need both to collect the necessary data and to analyze it correctly.},

We show in a model that directed innovation can either mitigate or exacerbate climate change’s potential economic damage depending on the substitutability between new technology and favorable climatic conditions. To empirically investigate the technological response to climate change, we measure crop-speciﬁc exposure to damaging extreme temperatures and crop-speciﬁc innovation embodied in new variety releases and patents. We ﬁnd that innovation has re-directed since the mid 20th century toward crops with increasing exposure to extreme temperatures. Moreover, this eﬀect is driven by types of agricultural technology most related to environmental adaptation. We next show that US counties’ exposure to induced innovation signiﬁcantly dampens the local economic damage from extreme temperatures. Combining these estimates with the model, we ﬁnd that directed innovation has oﬀset 20\% of potential losses in US agricultural land value due to damaging climate trends since 1960, and that innovation could oﬀset 13\% of projected damage by 2100. These ﬁndings highlight the vital importance, but incomplete eﬀectiveness, of endogenous technological change as a source of adaptation to climate change.},

We also ﬁnd that cross-sectional variation in rainfall cannot be conﬁdently used to replicate within-population rainfall variability.

I do this by inferring the marginal regulatory “cost” of building an additional housing unit, conditioning on a parcel’s total acreage and developed floor space. Regression on variables from the Wharton land use survey offers basic validation of this measure. I show that the inferred unit regulatory costs vary drastically across cities and neighborhoods; they tend to increase in both distance from the central business district and median household income and decrease in existing population density and college-educated population share. Finally, I show that regulatory costs tend to be cyclical, as the market incentive for developers to build at higher densities is strongest during boom periods.},

Researchers studying these markets generally assume contracts are short-lived. In the United States, hospitals and commercial insurers calculate prices as long-lived multiples of quantities used as benchmarks, such as hospital-set list prices and government-set Medicare payments. This study uses a unique panel dataset on hospital–insurer contracts to study how persistent increases to Medicare reimbursement would impact negotiated payments on behalf of the commercially insured. I extend standard vertical market models to accommodate forward-looking bargaining over multiperiod contracts, and I prove the extension uniquely controls the growth of relevant bargaining states. I apply the model to consider a one-percentage-point annual increase in Medicare payments. The model allows forward-looking negotiators to offset future Medicare-driven price increases by reducing starting prices. After nine years, I estimate that spending on behalf of the commercially insured would increase by 1.319\%. Extrapolated nationally, the change would increase 2015 spending by \$4.98 billion. In contrast, a myopic model lacking forward-looking offsets would overestimate the effect of the Medicare reimbursement reform by \$2.35 billion.},

Using administrative data on tenants of units funded by the Low-Income Housing Tax Credit (LIHTC), we first show that tenant characteristics such as race and proxies for need vary widely across neighborhoods. Despite fixed eligibility requirements, tenants of LIHTC developments in higher-opportunity neighborhoods are higher income, more educated, and far less likely to be Black. To quantify the welfare implications, we build a residential choice model in which households choose from both market-rate and affordable housing options, where the latter must be rationed. While providing affordable housing in higher-opportunity neighborhoods costs more, it also increases household welfare and reduces city-wide segregation. The gains in household welfare, however, accrue to more moderate-need and white (non-Hispanic) households at the expense of high-need and Black or Hispanic households. This change in the distribution of assistance is primarily due to a ‘crowding out’ effect: households that only apply for assistance in higher-opportunity neighborhoods crowd out those willing to apply regardless of location. Other policy levers—such as lowering the income limits used for means-testing—have only limited effects relative to the initial choice of location.},

Policymakers often justify these programs as a means of stimulating infant industries, arguing that greater demand increases industry learningby-doing, which in turn reduces costs for potential entrants. This requires learning spillovers between firms that make experience-based cost reductions a public good. However, spillovers can reduce firms’ incentives to expand output and lower costs. To evaluate this tradeoff, I estimate a dynamic structural model of the market for solar panel installations in California that endogenizes firms’ entry and exit decisions and allows for learning-by-doing with knowledge spillovers. I find that a 1\% increase in a firm’s cumulative production leads to a 0.7\% reduction in installation-specific costs and that learning spills over across firms. Counterfactual analysis reveals that a state-level consumer subsidy program increased solar adoption by 4\% and installer entry by 9\%, indicating that industry cost reductions outweigh any strategic incentives for firms to reduce learning. While consumer subsidies achieve industry growth, I find that standard industrial policies such as entry subsidies provide greater welfare gains.},

I use handcollected data and a novel identiﬁcation strategy to show that after adopting digital platforms, banks branchlessly operate in more markets, and mid-size banks – those with relatively high quality digital platforms but without extensive branch networks – grow faster. Further, bank balance sheet composition tilts to uninsured deposits on the funding side, and to high income borrowers on the loan side. To disentangle the underlying mechanisms and quantify aggregate eﬀects, I build a structural model of the U.S. banking system and compare the observed digital equilibrium to a counterfactual without digital platforms. The model allows for endogenous adoption of digital platforms, branch networks, market entry, and accounts for digitalization among non-banks. Digitalization decreases local and national market concentration, and average markups fall in deposit and loan markets, holding ﬁxed the size of the banking sector. Consumers capture most of the surplus created by digitalization, however it accrues mostly to wealthier segments of the economy. As for stability, it increases the average market share of lightly-regulated mid-sized banks by 29\%, increases the uninsured deposits ratio of the banking sector by 9\% while re-sorting uninsured deposits towards larger digital banks, and doubles credit risks associated with lending in market segments that are less-well served by digital technologies. In sum, digital banking increases competition and poses risks to ﬁnancial stability.},

	abstract = {State-owned enterprises (SOEs) have the potential to correct market failures, but they are also subject to the influence of politics and interest groups. We examine this trade-off in the context of the nationalization of the leading gasoline company in Argentina. Descriptive analysis suggests that pricing patterns changed after the nationalization. First, the government exerted less market power, charging lower prices on average. Second, it engaged in less economic price discrimination, reducing the correlation between prices and consumers’ willingness to pay. Third, it engaged in political price discrimination, charging lower prices in provinces with political connections with the state-owned firm. We develop and estimate a model of gasoline supply and demand under market power and recover the government’s objective function. We find that public provision leads to welfare gains but is also associated with political motives. Compared to a benevolent planner—that internalizes the welfare of all consumers and firms equally— the government sets prices as if it only values specific groups: middleincome households in general and low-income households in provinces with political connections. Lastly, we study the company’s response to policy alternatives, including pricing rules that are in place in government agencies worldwide. Our findings show that rules effectively reduce the influence of politics in pricing but are associated with higher costs: they offset half of the welfare gains generated by the nationalization and increase the taxpayers’ burden by 10\%. These findings emphasize the importance of politics in shaping governments’ decisions and the role of SOEs as instruments for redistribution.},

The social stances taken by ﬁrms increase revenue on average, with signiﬁcant heterogeneity across consumers and ﬁrm stances. Consumers most aligned with a ﬁrm’s social stance increase their consumption at the ﬁrm by 19 percent in the month following widely known social stance events, and consumers most opposed to the ﬁrm’s stance decrease their consumption by 11 percent. These diverging consumption responses attenuate over time but persist even a year later. Firms tend to take stances that align with their consumers’ and employees’ social preferences and that correlate with the ﬁrm’s ownership structure. Together our results show that consumers meaningfully respond to their social alignment with ﬁrms, and that this consumer response can incentivize proﬁt-maximizing ﬁrms to engage with social issues.},

	abstract = {Centralized matching markets that prioritize specific participants to achieve certain policy goals are common in practice, but priority is often assigned using endogenous characteristics of participants. In the heart transplant waitlist in the United States, the treatment that a patient receives is used to assign waitlist priority. Policymakers recently changed the prioritization in an attempt to reduce waitlist mortality by assigning higher priority to patients receiving specific treatments previously associated with high waitlist mortality. First, I document a significant response to waitlist incentives in treatments given and transplants that take place. Then, I develop and estimate a structural model of treatment and transplant choices to evaluate the effect of the policy change on patients’ outcomes and doctors’ decisions. I find three main results from my model. First, there is little change in aggregate survival, and the effect of the change has been mainly redistributive. Second, the change has effectively targeted patients with lower untransplanted survival, with these patients receiving higher expected survival under the current design. Third, the effect on survival is largely driven by changes in the decision to accept/decline offers for transplants rather than directly due to a change in treatment decisions. The policy implications suggest that future designs of the waitlist should disincentivize declining offers for transplants.},

	abstract = {In this paper, we study how demand-side subsidies interact with the equilibrium level of price and quality in the higher education sector in Brazil. More precisely, we consider two policies that assist low-income students in attending private institutions: scholarships and subsidized student loans. First, we develop a quality measure for undergraduate programs using value-added models, where a student’s post-graduation outcome is determined by their pre-enrollment characteristics. To do so, we link multiple administrative datasets to track individual students before enrollment, during college, and after college. We consider two post-graduation outcomes: a standardized “exit” exam, which tests students’ major-specific knowledge, and income from a matched employer-employee database. We document key patterns and correlations of our quality measure and extensively validate it. Next, we develop a static equilibrium model of demand, pricing, and quality provision. We consider two counterfactuals: decreasing the supply of loans by 10\% and decreasing the supply of scholarships by 10\%. We find similar patterns under both scenarios but much stronger effects for scholarships. Specifically, by lowering the supply of scholarships by 10\% in each program across the country, there would be 13 thousand fewer students in college, corresponding to 80\% of the total reduction in scholarships. Most programs would have an incentive to decrease quality and price, with a median change in value-added of -5\% and of -0.7\% in price. Crucially, our approach uncovers significant heterogeneity across programs, particularly in terms of student composition and the effects of these policy changes, offering valuable insights into the nuanced impacts of educational subsidies.},

Our empirical strategy obtains a panel of consumer preferences and marginal costs based on the estimation of separate random coefficient models by category and year. We find that markups increased by about 30 percent on average over the sample period. The change is primarily attributable to decreases in marginal costs, as real prices only increased slightly from 2006 to 2019.

It is known that when a monopoly right is auctioned, auctions select the bidder that is least risk-averse. This ﬁrm will choose a higher value of the aftermarket strategic variable than any other ﬁrm will do, thereby implying a higher market price under price setting behavior and a lower price due to higher quantity under quantity-setting behavior. This paper extends the analysis to oligopoly aftermarkets and analyzes whether the monopoly result carries over to oligopoly settings. We argue that with multiple licenses and demand uncertainty auctions actually perform even worse from a welfare point of view than the monopoly case would suggest. A strategic effect strengthens the monopoly result with respect to prices, but weakens the result with respect to quantities.},

Procurement mechanisms used by large organizations, including framework agreements (FAs), which are widely used in the public sector, often take this form. When choosing the assortment, the procurement agency must optimize the tradeoff between offering a richer menu of products for consumers and offering less variety, hoping to engage the suppliers in more aggressive price competition. We formulate the problem faced by the procurement agency as a mechanism design problem, and we progressively incorporate more complex and often more realistic implementation constraints, including that the allocations should be decentralized (that is, consumers choose what to buy) and that payments must be implemented through linear pricing (in particular, no up-front payments are allowed). We characterize the optimal buying mechanisms that highlight the importance of restricting the entry of close-substitute products to the assortment as a way to increase price competition without much damage to variety. Motivated by the implementation of the Chilean FAs, which are being used to acquire around US\$3 billion in goods and services per year, we leverage our characterization of the optimal mechanism to study the design of ﬁrstprice-auction-type mechanisms that are commonly used in public settings.

Academic/practical relevance: Modern buying channels, including e-commerce and public procurement, often consist of a platform that mediates transactions. Frequently, these platforms implement simple and transparent mechanisms to induce suppliers’ direct participation, which typically results in pay-as-bid (or first-price) mechanisms where suppliers set their prices. Methodology: We introduce a novel class of assortment mechanisms that we call k-soft reserves (k-SRs): If at least k suppliers choose a price below the soft-reserve price, then only those suppliers are added to the assortment; otherwise, all the suppliers are added. Results: We show the optimality of k-SRs for a class of stylized symmetric models to derive the intuition behind these mechanisms. Then, through extensive numerical simulations, we provide evidence of the robustness of k-SRs in more general and realistic settings. Managerial implications: Our results give intuitive and simple-to-use prescriptions on how to optimize pay-as-bid assort­ ment mechanisms in practice, with an emphasis on public procurement settings.},

	abstract = {We investigate the welfare effects of vertical integration of regional sports networks (RSNs) with programming distributors in U.S. multichannel television markets. Vertical integration can enhance efﬁciency by reducing double marginalization and increasing carriage of channels, but can also harm welfare due to foreclosure and incentives to raise rivals’ costs. We estimate a structural model of viewership, subscription, distributor pricing, and afﬁliate fee bargaining using a rich data set on the U.S. cable and satellite television industry (2000–2010). We use these estimates to analyze the impact of simulated vertical mergers and divestitures of RSNs on competition and welfare, and examine the efﬁcacy of regulatory policies introduced by the U.S. Federal Communications Commission to address competition concerns in this industry.},

We explain that the empirical evidence relating to concentration trends, markup trends, and the effects of mergers does not actually show a widespread decline in competition.

To the contrary, in many respects the evidence indicates that the observed changes in many industries are likely to reflect competition in action. We highlight research that points to targeted interventions that can enable antitrust enforcement policy to better promote and protect competition.

	abstract = {The main advantage of a procurement combinatorial auction (CA) is that it allows suppliers to express cost synergies through package bids. However, bidders can also strategically take advantage of this flexibility, by discounting package bids and "inflating" bid prices for single items, even in the absence of cost synergies; the latter behavior can hurt the performance of the auction. It is an empirical question whether allowing package bids and running a CA improves performance in a given setting. In this paper, we develop a structural estimation approach that estimates the firms' cost structure using bidding data and use these estimates to evaluate the performance of the auction. To overcome the computational difficulties arising from the large number of bids observed in large-scale CAs, we propose a novel simplified model of bidders' behavior based on pricing package characteristics. We apply our method to the Chilean school meals auction, in which the government procures half a billion dollars' worth of meal services every year and bidders submit thousands of package bids. Our estimates suggest that bidders' cost synergies are economically significant in this application ({\textasciitilde}5\%), and the current CA mechanism achieves high allocative efficiency ({\textasciitilde}98\%) and reasonable margins for the bidders ({\textasciitilde}5\%). Overall, this work develops the first practical tool to evaluate the performance of large-scale first-price CAs commonly used in procurement settings.},

This paper is one of the first in the literature that provides a formal understanding of FAs, with a particular focus on the cost uncertainty bidders face over the FA time horizon. We generalize standard auction models to include this salient feature of FAs and analyze this model theoretically and numerically. First, we show that FAs are subject to a sort of winner’s curse that in equilibrium induces higher expected buying prices relative to running first-price auctions as needs arise. Then, our results provide concrete design recommendations that alleviate this issue and decrease buying prices in FAs, highlighting the importance of (i) monitoring the price charged at the open market by the FA winner to bound the buying price; (ii) implementing price indexes for the random part of suppliers’ costs; and (iii) allowing suppliers the flexibility to reduce their prices to compete with the open market throughout the selling horizon. These prescriptions are already being used by the Chilean government procurement agency that buys US\$2 billion worth of contracts yearly using FAs.

In Chile’s central procurement agency (ChileCompra), FAs accounted for 23\% of the procurement expenditures during 2018-19. However, descriptive analysis of purchase transaction data suggests that some FAs exhibited low levels of competition in the auctions used to select the suppliers, which could potentially result in larger government expenditures. We collaborated with ChileCompra to redesign FAs to enhance competition introducing two important changes: (i) standardize the product catalogue using natural language processing algorithms; (ii) use this product standardization to induce more competition in the auctions to select suppliers. These changes were implemented through an experimental approach in a redesigned Food FA to measure its impact, showing that inducing more intense competition in the auction stage reduced transaction prices by 8\%. This pilot study ultimately led ChileCompra to implement a similar design in all of its FAs, and many of the improvements in the design of the FAs were included in the new regulation on government purchases. If we were to extrapolate the savings from our pilot re-design to all of these FAs, the total savings would amount to around \$74 million in 2022.},

	abstract = {The greatest problem for empirical analysis is how best to allow the context to affect the inferences. Econometric theory presupposes contextual “restrictions” that can be taken as given or assigned a probability distribution. These contextual inputs are rarely available. I illustrate this point with a review of the empirical work in international economics which has focused not on properties of estimators but instead how best to link the theory with the data. I argue that the two errors we should worry about are not rejecting a true null or accepting a false null but rather taking the theory too seriously and not taking the theory seriously enough.},

	abstract = {Without a doubt, there has been a “credibility revolution” in applied econometrics. One contributing development has been in the improvement and increased use in data analysis of “structural methods”; that is, the use of models based in economic theory. Structural modeling attempts to use data to identify the parameters of an underlying economic model, based on models of individual choice or aggregate relations derived from them. Structural estimation has a long tradition in economics, but better and larger data sets, more powerful computers, improved modeling methods, faster computational techniques, and new econometric methods such as those mentioned above have allowed researchers to make significant improvements. While Angrist and Pischke extol the successes of empirical work that estimates “treatment effects” based on actual or quasi-experiments, they are much less sanguine about structural analysis and hold industrial organization up as an example where “progress is less dramatic.” Indeed, reading their article one comes away with the impression that there is only a single way to conduct credible empirical analysis. This seems to us a very narrow and dogmatic approach to empirical work; credible analysis can come in many guises, both structural and nonstructural, and for some questions structural analysis offers important advantages. In this comment, we address the criticism of structural analysis and its use in industrial organization, and consider why empirical analysis in industrial organization differs in such striking ways from that in field such as labor, which have recently emphasized the methods favored by Angrist and Pischke.},

A closer look shows that stricter laws correlate with improved outcomes, but only in countries with low public sector capacity.

In the model, regulation is effective in countries with low public sector capacity, but not in countries with high capacity because it inhibits the socially optimal exercise of discretion to exclude low quality bidders.},

Conceptually, opening contracts up to bids by more participants leads to lower awarding prices, but may hinder buyers’ control over non-contractible characteristics of prospective contractors. Leveraging a regulation that mandates agencies to publicize certain contract opportunities, we document that expanding the set of bidders reduces award prices, but deteriorates post-award performance, resulting in more cost overruns and delays. To further study the scope of this tension, we develop and estimate a model in which the buyer endogenously chooses the intensity of competition, invited sellers decide on auction participation and bidding, and the winner executes the contract ex-post. Model estimates indicate substantial heterogeneity in ex-post performance across contractors, and show that simple adjustments to the current regulation that account for adverse selection could provide 2 percent of savings in procurement spending, or \$104 million annually.},

This class of model is used widely in theoretical analysis of retail pricing. We quantify cross-category pricing effects and find that internalizing them substantially reduces market power. We find that consumers inclined to one-stop (rather than multi-stop) shopping have a greater pro-competitive impact because they generate relatively large cross-category effects.},

This article uses a unique data set with round‐the‐clock posted fares to document significant within‐day price variation. Labeling time‐variation as discriminatory is difficult because the cost of an unsold airline seat changes with inventory, days before departure, and aggregate demand expectations. After controlling for these factors and aggregating hourly fares to have a framework with two consumer types, we are able to identify a component that is largely consistent with dynamic price discrimination. We find higher prices during office hours (when business travelers are likely to buy) and lower prices in the evening (when leisure travelers are more likely to purchase). As the proportion of business travelers increases closer to departure, both price dispersion and price discrimination become larger. We provide an alternative explanation for the observed within‐day price differentials which is related to Edgeworth price cycles.},

With respect to the empirical literature on entry games originated by Bresnahan and Reiss (1990) and Berry (1992), the main novelty of our framework is to allow for general forms of heterogeneity across players without making equilibrium selection assumptions. We allow the effects that the entry of each individual airline has on the proﬁts of its competitors, its “competitive effects,” to differ across airlines. The identiﬁed features of the model are sets of parameters (partial identiﬁcation) such that the choice probabilities predicted by the econometric model are consistent with the empirical choice probabilities estimated from the data. We apply this methodology to investigate the empirical importance of ﬁrm heterogeneity as a determinant of market structure in the U.S. airline industry. We ﬁnd evidence of heterogeneity across airlines in their proﬁt functions. The competitive effects of large airlines (American, Delta, United) are different from those of low cost carriers and Southwest. Also, the competitive effect of an airline is increasing in its airport presence, which is an important measure of observable heterogeneity in the airline industry. Then we develop a policy experiment to estimate the effect of repealing the Wright Amendment on competition in markets out of the Dallas airports. We ﬁnd that repealing the Wright Amendment would increase the number of markets served out of Dallas Love.},

	abstract = {The impact of insurer competition on welfare, negotiated provider prices, and premiums in the U.S. private health care industry is theoretically ambiguous. Reduced competition may increase the premiums charged by insurers and their payments made to hospitals. However, it may also strengthen insurers’ bargaining leverage when negotiating with hospitals, thereby generating offsetting cost decreases. To understand and measure this trade-off, we estimate a model of employer-insurer and hospitalinsurer bargaining over premiums and reimbursements, household demand for insurance, and individual demand for hospitals using detailed California admissions, claims, and enrollment data. We simulate the removal of both large and small insurers from consumers’ choice sets. Although consumer welfare decreases and premiums typically increase, we ﬁnd that premiums can fall upon the removal of a small insurer if an employer imposes effective premium constraints through negotiations with the remaining insurers. We also document substantial heterogeneity in hospital price adjustments upon the removal of an insurer, with renegotiated price increases and decreases of as much as 10\% across markets.},

Previous researchers have concluded that the ready-to-eat cereal industry is a classic example of an industry with nearly collusive pricing behavior and intense nonprice competition. This paper empirically examines this conclusion. In particular, I estimate price-cost margins, but more importantly I am able empirically to separate these margins into three sources: Ži. that which is due to product differentiation; Žii. that which is due to multi-product ﬁrm pricing; and Žiii. that due to potential price collusion. The results suggest that given the demand for different brands of cereal, the ﬁrst two effects explain most of the observed price-cost margins. I conclude that prices in the industry are consistent with noncollusive pricing behavior, despite the high price-cost margins. Leading ﬁrms are able to maintain a portfolio of differentiated products and inﬂuence the perceived product quality. It is these two factors that lead to high price-cost margins.},

	abstract = {Algorithmic pricing can improve efficiency by helping firms set prices that are more responsive to changing market conditions. However, widespread adoption of the same algorithm could also lead to price coordination, resulting in elevated prices. In this paper, we examine the impact of algorithmic pricing on the U.S. multifamily rental housing market using hand-collected adoption decisions of property management companies merged with the data of market-rate multifamily apartments from 2005 to 2019. First, our findings suggest that algorithm adoption helps building managers set more responsive prices: buildings with the software increase prices during booms and lower prices during busts, compared to non-adopters in the same market. Second, when compared across markets, we find markets with greater algorithm penetration also experienced higher rents and lower occupancy in the post-crisis period. Lastly, we estimate a structural model of housing demand and perform a test of conduct to evaluate the “algorithmic coordination” hypothesis. Our pair-wise tests favor joint profit maximization among adopters of the same software, suggesting considerable markup increases due to the coordination channel on the order of \$53 per unit per month, affecting over 2.6 million units. However, our tests do not find support for coordinated prices between different algorithms. Our findings have implications for regulators and policymakers concerned about potential risks and tradeoffs associated with algorithmic pricing.},

Additionally, our access to detailed retail and wholesale pricing enables the direct assessment of markups, a measure often unavailable to researchers. The analyses yield three key findings: first, an increase in the number of nearby competitors is associated with lower retailer markups, although the marginal effect decreases as competition intensifies. Second, retailers respond to greater competition by differentiating their assortments. Third, this differentiation strategy helps mitigate the intensity of price competition among retailers.},

We ﬁnd that a \$10 decrease in monthly premium subsidies would cause a decline of between 1.8\% and 6.7\% in the proportion of subsidized adults with coverage. The reduction in total annual consumer surplus would be between \$62 and \$74 million, while the savings in yearly subsidy outlays would be between \$207 and \$602 million. We estimate the demand impacts of linking subsidies to age, ﬁnding that shifting subsidies from older to younger buyers would increase average consumer surplus, with potentially large impacts on enrollment. We also estimate the consumer surplus impact of removing the highly-subsidized plans in the Silver metal tier, where we ﬁnd that a nonparametric model is consistent with a wide range of possibilities. We ﬁnd that comparable mixed logit models tend to yield price sensitivity estimates toward the lower end of the nonparametric bounds, while producing consumer surplus impacts that can be both higher and lower than the nonparametric bounds depending on the speciﬁcation of random coefﬁcients.},

My estimates show that the weekday New York market achieves about \$5.7 million in daily welfare or about \$27 per trip, but an additional 53 thousand customers fail to ﬁnd cabs due to search frictions. Counterfactual analysis shows that implementing simple tariﬀ pricing changes can enhance allocative eﬃciency and expand the market, oﬀering daily consumer surplus gains of up to \$227 thousand and up to 49 thousand additional daily taxi-passenger matches, a similar magnitude to the gain in matches generated by adopting a perfect static matching technology.},

Moreover, we ﬁnd that the heterogeneity in counterfactual land use introduces adverse selection in the market. We then develop and estimate a joint model of multi-dimensional bidding and land use to quantify the implications of this market failure for the performance of environmental procurement mechanisms and competitive oﬀset markets. We design alternative auctions with scoring rules that incorporate the expected impact of the auction on bidders’ land use. These auctions increase eﬃciency by using bids and observed characteristics to select participants based on both costs and expected additionality.},

For example, we show that, at least in our context, abstracting from selection on moral hazard could lead to overestimates of the spending reduction associated with introducing a high-deductible health insurance option.

Using comprehensive data and internal models from a large U.S. airline, we establish that airline pricing is not well approximated by a model of the firm as a unitary decision maker. We show that observed prices, however, can be rationalized by accounting for organizational structure and for the decisions by departments that are tasked with supplying inputs to the observed pricing heuristic. Simulating the prices the firm would charge if it were a rational, unitary decision maker results in lower welfare than we estimate under observed practices. Finally, we discuss why counterfactual estimates of welfare and market power may be biased if prices are set through decomposition, but we instead assume that they are set by unitary decision makers.},

            We show that most U.S. food, drugstore, and mass-merchandise chains charge nearly uniform prices across stores, despite wide variation in consumer demographics and competition. Demand estimates reveal substantial within-chain variation in price elasticities and suggest that the median chain sacrifices \$\{{\textbackslash}\$\}\$16 million of annual profit relative to a benchmark of optimal prices. In contrast, differences in average prices between chains are broadly consistent with the optimal benchmark. We discuss a range of explanations for nearly uniform pricing, highlighting managerial inertia and brand image concerns as mechanisms frequently mentioned by industry participants. Relative to our optimal benchmark, uniform pricing may significantly increase the prices paid by poorer households relative to the rich, dampen the response of prices to local economic shocks, alter the analysis of mergers in antitrust, and shift the incidence of intranational trade costs.},

We structurally estimate a dynamic model of consumer choice using two years of scanner data on the purchasing behavior of a panel of households. The results suggest that static demand estimates, which neglect dynamics, (i) overestimate own-price elasticities by 30 percent, (ii) underestimate cross-price elasticities by up to a factor of 5, and (iii) overestimate the substitution to the no-purchase or outside option by over 200 percent. This suggests that policy analysis based on static elasticity estimates will underestimate price-cost margins and underpredict the effects of mergers.},

	abstract = {The estimation of demand models for differentiated products often relies on data from multiple geographic markets and time periods. The fact that firms do not offer some products in some markets generates a problem of endogenous selection in demand estimation. The non-additivity of demand unobservables in firms’ expected profit and the potential multiplicity of equilibria in the entry game, make this selection problem challenging. Standard two-step methods to account for selection provide inconsistent estimates of structural parameters. Recent proposed methods require parametetric assumptions on the distribution of unobservables as well as repeatedlly computing for equilibria in the game. In this paper, we show the identification of demand parameters in a structural model of demand, price competition, and market entry that allows for a nonparametric distribution of demand unobservables. We propose a two-step method that extends standard methods to control for selection bias. We illustrate our method using simulated data and real data from the airline industry. We show that not accounting for endogenous product entry generates substantial biases that can be even larger than those from ignoring price endogeneity.},

From the point of view of an empirical researcher, the literature on inference in moment inequality models is large and complex, including multiple survey papers that document the non-standard features these models possess, the main novel concepts behind inference in these models, and the most recent developments that bring advances in accuracy and computational tractability. In this paper we present a guide to empirical practice intended to help applied researchers navigate all the de­ cisions required to frame a model as a moment inequality model and then to construct confidence intervals for the parameters of interest. We divide our template into four main steps: (a) a behavioral decision model, (b) moving from the decision model to a moment inequality model, (c) choosing a test statistic and critical value, and (d) accounting for computational challenges. We split each of these steps into a discussion of the “how” and the “why”, and then illustrate how to take these steps to practice in an empirical application that studies identification of expected sunk costs of offering a product in a market.},

Our empirical focus is on estimating the parameters of a production function for the equipment industry, and then using those estimates to analyze the evolution of plant-level productivity. The restructuring involved significant entry and exit and large changes in the sizes of incumbents. Firms' choices on whether to liquidate, and on input quantities should they continue, depended on their productivity. This generates a selection and a simultaneity problem when estimating production functions. Our theoretical focus is on providing an estimation algorithm which takes explicit account of these issues. We find that our algorithm produces markedly different and more plausible estimates of production function coefficients than do traditional estimation procedures. Using our estimates we find increases in the rate of aggregate productivity growth after deregulation. Since we have plant-level data we can introduce indices which delve deeper into how this productivity growth occurred. These indices indicate that productivity increases were primarily a result of a reallocation of capital towards more productive establishments.},

	abstract = {Dramatic changes are occurring in the nature of international trade. Production processes increasingly involve a sequential, vertical trading chain stretching across many countries, with each country specializing in particular stages of a good’s production sequence. We document a key aspect of these vertical linkages — the use of imported inputs in producing goods that are exported — which we call vertical specialization. Using input–output tables from 10 OECD and four emerging market countries we calculate that vertical specialization accounts for 21\% of these countries’ exports, and grew almost 30\% between 1970 and 1990. We also ﬁnd that growth in vertical specialization accounts for 30\% of the growth in these countries’ exports. © 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

Our discussion emphasizes how empirical strategies can leverage different features of data depending on the sources of variation that are commonly found in applied work. Moving to the supply-side, we show how demand estimates combined with a pricing model, can be used to recover markups and marginal costs. We also show how the model of pricing can be tested. We discuss a baseline Bertrand-Nash model of competitive pricing, and expand it to cover (a) coordinated pricing, (b) wholesale relationships, and (c) bargaining.

	title = {Volatility and the {Gains} from {Trade}},
	abstract = {Trade liberalization changes the volatility of returns by reducing the negative correlation between local prices and productivity shocks. In this paper, we explore these second moment eﬀects of trade. Using forty years of agricultural micro-data from India, we show that falling trade costs due to expansions of the Indian highway network reduced the responsiveness of local prices to local yields but increased the responsiveness of local prices to yields elsewhere. In response, farmers shifted their production toward crops with less volatile yields, especially so for those with poor access to risk mitigating technologies such as banks. We then characterize how volatility aﬀects farmer’s crop allocation using a portfolio choice framework where returns are determined in general equilibrium by a many-location, many-good Ricardian trade model with ﬂexible trade costs. Finally, we structurally estimate the model—recovering farmers’ risk-return preferences from the gradient of the mean-variance frontier at their observed crop choices—to quantify the second moment eﬀects of trade. The simultaneous expansion of both the highway and rural bank networks increased the mean and the variance of farmer real income, with the ﬁrst-moment eﬀect dominating such that expected welfare rose 4.4\%. But had rural bank access remained unchanged, welfare gains would have been only half as great, as risk-mitigating technologies allowed farmers to take advantage of higher-risk higher-return allocations.},

            After decades of supporting free trade, in 2018 the United States raised import tariffs and major trade partners retaliated. We analyze the short-run impact of this return to protectionism on the U.S. economy. Import and retaliatory tariffs caused large declines in imports and exports. Prices of imports targeted by tariffs did not fall, implying complete pass-through of tariffs to duty-inclusive prices. The resulting losses to U.S. consumers and firms that buy imports was \$51 billion, or 0.27\% of GDP. We embed the estimated trade elasticities in a general-equilibrium model of the U.S. economy. After accounting for tariff revenue and gains to domestic producers, the aggregate real income loss was \$7.2 billion, or 0.04\% of GDP. Import tariffs favored sectors concentrated in politically competitive counties, and the model implies that tradeable-sector workers in heavily Republican counties were the most negatively affected due to the retaliatory tariffs.

	abstract = {This paper develops a dynamic industry model with heterogeneous firms to analyze the intra-industry effects of international trade. The model shows how the exposure to trade will induce only the more productive firms to enter the export market (while some less productive firms continue to produce only for the domestic market) and will simultaneously force the least productive firms to exit. It then shows how further increases in the industry's exposure to trade lead to additional inter-firm reallocations towards more productive firms. The paper also shows how the aggregate industry productivity growth generated by the reallocations contributes to a welfare gain, thus highlighting a benefit from trade that has not been examined theoretically before. The paper adapts Hopenhayn's (1992a) dynamic industry model to monopolistic competition in a general equilibrium setting. In so doing, the paper provides an extension of Krugman's (1980) trade model that incorporates firm level productivity differences. Firms with different productivity levels coexist in an industry because each firm faces initial uncertainty concerning its productivity before making an irreversible investment to enter the industry. Entry into the export market is also costly, but the firm's decision to export occurs after it gains knowledge of its productivity.},

	abstract = {Research in international trade has changed dramatically over the last twenty years, as attention has shifted from countries and industries towards the firms actually engaged in international trade. The now-standard heterogeneous firm model posits measure-zero firms that compete under monopolistic competition and decide whether to export to foreign markets. However, much of international trade is dominated by a few “global firms,” which participate in the international economy along multiple margins and account for substantial shares of aggregate trade. We develop a new theoretical framework that allows firms to have large market shares and decide simultaneously on the set of production locations, export markets, input sources, products to export, and inputs to import. Using US firm and trade transactions data, we provide strong evidence in support of this framework's main predictions of interdependencies and complementarities between these margins of firm international participation. Global firms participate more intensively along each margin, magnifying the impact of underlying differences in firm characteristics and increasing their shares of aggregate trade.

A large literature in econometrics develops procedures for detecting weak instruments and constructing robust conﬁdence sets, but many of the results in this literature are limited to settings with independent and homoskedastic data, while data encountered in practice frequently violate these assumptions. We review the literature on weak instruments in linear IV regression with an emphasis on results for non-homoskedastic (heteroskedastic, serially correlated, or clustered) data. To assess the practical importance of weak instruments, we also report tabulations and simulations based on a survey of papers published in the American Economic Review from 2014 to 2018 that use instrumental variables. These results suggest that weak instruments remain an important issue for empirical practice, and that there are simple steps researchers can take to better handle weak instruments in applications.},

The dataset incorporates over 3,700 annual observations covering a wide range of political systems, institutions, exchange rate arrangements, and historic circumstances. Our main findings are: First, the relationship between government debt and real GDP growth is weak for debt/GDP ratios below a threshold of 90 percent of GDP. Above 90 percent, median growth rates fall by one percent, and average growth falls considerably more. We find that the threshold for public debt is similar in advanced and emerging economies. Second, emerging markets face lower thresholds for external debt (public and private)—which is usually denominated in a foreign currency. When external debt reaches 60 percent of GDP, annual growth declines by about two percent; for higher levels, growth rates are roughly cut in half. Third, there is no apparent contemporaneous link between inflation and public debt levels for the advanced countries as a group (some countries, such as the United States, have experienced higher inflation when debt/GDP is high). The story is entirely different for emerging markets, where inflation rises sharply as debt increases.},

Our discussion highlights the different ways that the DiD literature has advanced beyond the canonical model, and helps to clarify when each of the papers will be relevant for empirical work.

            The Neolithic revolution saw the independent development of agriculture among at least seven unconnected hunter-gatherer populations. I propose that the rapid spread of agricultural techniques resulted from increased climatic seasonality causing hunter-gatherers to adopt a sedentary lifestyle and store food for the season of scarcity. Their newfound sedentary lifestyle and storage habits facilitated the invention of agriculture. I present a model and support it with global climate data and Neolithic adoption dates, showing that higher seasonality increased the likelihood of agriculture’s invention and its speed of adoption by neighbors. This study suggests that seasonality patterns played a dominant role in determining our species’ transition to farming.},

The effects of these factors are estimated by applying kernel density methods to appropriately weighted samples. The procedure provides a visually clear representation of where in the density of wages these various factors exert the greatest impact. Using data from the Current Population Survey, we find, as in previous research, that de-unionization and supply and demand shocks were important factors in explaining the rise in wage inequality from 1979 to 1988. We find also compelling visual and quantitative evidence that the decline in the real value of the minimum wage explains a substantial proportion of this increase in wage inequality, particularly for women. We conclude that labor market institutions are as important as supply and demand considerations in explaining changes in the U.S. distribution of wages from 1979 to 1988.},

Hence, it is important to understand how discount retail chains choose store locations. In this paper, I study the store location decisions of those retail chains, examine the role of preemptive incentives, and evaluate the impact of government subsidies. I model retail chains’ store location decisions using a dynamic entry game. The model extends the empirical models of dynamic oligopoly entry by allowing for spatially interdependent entry and introducing machine learning tools to infer market divisions from data. The estimation results suggest that preemptive incentives are important in chain stores’ location decisions and that they lead to loss of production eﬃciency. On average, the loss of producer surplus due to preemption is at least one million dollars per store.},

We show substantial adoption of disclosure, but also a 12\% increase in sponsored content, and an increase in the share of undisclosed-sponsored content consumers are exposed to. We also find reductions in engagement, suggesting that followers were likely negatively affected.},

In addition to the usual data on prices and quantities, our method incorporates triplets data (of the form “product A is closer to B than it is to C”) obtained from an online survey. The triplets are used to compute an embedding—i.e., a low-dimensional representation of the latent product space—which can then be used either (i) as a substitute for data on observed characteristics in a conventional mixed logit model, or (ii) to compute pairwise product distances that can discipline the cross-elasticity parameters of a simple log-linear demand model. We illustrate the performance of both approaches by estimating demand for ready-to-eat cereals, and ﬁnd that the information contained in the embedding leads to more plausible substitution patterns and better model ﬁt.},

Our framework does not require collecting product attributes for each category and can capture product similarity along dimensions that are hard to account for with observed attributes. We apply our method to a dataset describing the behavior of Amazon shoppers across several categories and show that incorporating texts and images in demand estimation helps us recover a flexible cross-price elasticity matrix.},

	abstract = {Consider a researcher estimating the parameters of a regression function based on data for all 50 states in the United States or on data for all visits to a website. What is the interpretation of the estimated parameters and the standard errors? In practice, researchers typically assume that the sample is randomly drawn from a large population of interest and report standard errors that are designed to capture sampling variation. This is common even in applications where it is difﬁcult to articulate what that population of interest is, and how it differs from the sample. In this article, we explore an alternative approach to inference, which is partly design-based. In a design-based setting, the values of some of the regressors can be manipulated, perhaps through a policy intervention. Design-based uncertainty emanates from lack of knowledge about the values that the regression outcome would have taken under alternative interventions. We derive standard errors that account for design-based uncertainty instead of, or in addition to, sampling-based uncertainty. We show that our standard errors in general are smaller than the usual inﬁnite-population sampling-based standard errors and provide conditions under which they coincide.},

Areas in which proprietary rights in land were historically given to landlords have significantly lower agricultural investments and productivity in the post-independence period than areas in which these rights were given to the cultivators. These areas also have significantly lower investments in health and education. These differences are not driven by omitted variables or endogeneity problems; they probably arise because differences in historical institutions lead to very different policy choices.},

	abstract = {Why do low income patients tend to go to lower quality health care providers, even when they are free? We show that differential information about provider quality is an important determinant of this disparity. Our empirical strategy exploits the temporary presence of a website that publicly displayed summary star ratings of general practitioner (GP) offices in England. Regression discontinuity estimates show that patient demand responds sharply to the information on the website, and that this response is almost entirely driven by residents of low income neighborhoods. The results are consistent with high income patients having better private information about quality. We incorporate our estimates into a structural model of demand that allows for heterogeneity in information, preferences, and consumer inertia. We find that information differences explain 24 percent of the relationship between income and GP quality and reinforce disparities in access to care.},

The first policy centralized applications in a nationwide platform (SISU), and the second expanded affirmative action quotas (AA) to a uniform share of 50 percent of vacancies offered by degree. Results show that SISU changes enrollment decisions of high-SES students, crowding out low-SES groups from the least competitive degrees disproportionately. In contrast, AA increases enrollments of low-SES individuals not only mechanically but also through behavioral responses. Finally, their interaction creates a complementary effect, protecting the low-SES groups from the crowding-out of centralization. (JEL I23, I24, I28, O15)},

Conclui-se que a expansão sem precedentes de vagas e matrículas no ensino superior, em conjunto com a diversificação institucional da oferta e políticas inclusivas, levou à heterogeneização do público discente e uma crescente estratificação horizontal. De um lado, aprofundou tendências já observadas em décadas anteriores, a exemplo do desbalanço entre os setores público e privado e da desigualdade interna do sistema em termos de prestígio e valorização de diplomas. De outro, inaugurou novos padrões, tais como a emergência do ensino a distância e uma participação inédita de segmentos menos privilegiados da sociedade brasileira, com impactos sobre o futuro do sistema.},

Although some studies identify party leaders as polarizing agents, affective polarization has been predominantly conceptualized as a product of in-/out-party feelings. This study compares levels of party affective polarization (PAP) and leader affective polarization (LAP) cross-nationally, using data from the Comparative Study of Electoral Systems. Applying like–dislike scales and an identical index to both concepts, we reveal that while the two strongly correlate, LAP is systematically lower than PAP. The United States emerges as an exceptional case, being the only country where LAP significantly exceeds PAP. Drawing on regime input/output and institutions as theoretical building blocks, we explore cross-national variations and show that the relative strength of LAP vis-à-vis PAP is increased by presidential regime type, poor government performance, and low party system fragmentation. The findings of this study contribute to the thriving research on affective polarization and personalization of politics.},

	abstract = {"Humans are a puzzling species. On the one hand, we struggle to survive on our own in the wild, often failing to overcome even basic challenges, like obtaining food, building shelters, or avoiding predators. On the other hand, human groups have produced ingenious technologies, sophisticated languages, and complex institutions that have permitted us to successfully expand into a vast range of diverse environments. What has enabled us to dominate the globe, more than any other species, while remaining virtually helpless as lone individuals? This book shows that the secret of our success lies not in our innate intelligence, but in our collective brains--on the ability of human groups to socially interconnect and learn from one another over generations. Drawing insights from lost European explorers, clever chimpanzees, mobile hunter-gatherers, neuroscientific findings, ancient bones, and the human genome, Joseph Henrich demonstrates how our collective brains have propelled our species' genetic evolution and shaped our biology. Our early capacities for learning from others produced many cultural innovations, such as fire, cooking, water containers, plant knowledge, and projectile weapons, which in turn drove the expansion of our brains and altered our physiology, anatomy, and psychology in crucial ways. Later on, some collective brains generated and recombined powerful concepts, such as the lever, wheel, screw, and writing, while also creating the institutions that continue to alter our motivations and perceptions. Henrich shows how our genetics and biology are inextricably interwoven with cultural evolution, and how culture-gene interactions launched our species on an extraordinary evolutionary trajectory. Tracking clues from our ancient past to the present, The Secret of Our Success explores how the evolution of both our cultural and social natures produce a collective intelligence that explains both our species' immense success and the origins of human uniqueness."--provided by publisher},

However, autocrats must fear that foreign journalists will unmask their wrongdoings. We argue that autocracies solve this dilemma by strategically adjusting repression according to the spatial-temporal presence of international media. Using original, highly disaggregated data on the 1978 World Cup, we demonstrate that the Argentine host government largely refrained from repression during the tournament but preemptively cleared the streets beforehand. These adjustments specifically occurred around hotels reserved for foreign journalists. Additional tests demonstrate that (1) before the tournament, repression turned increasingly covert, (2) during the tournament, targeting patterns mirrored the working shifts of foreign journalists, (3) after the tournament, regime violence again spiked in locations where international media had been present. Together, the article highlights the human costs of megaevents, contradicting the common whitewashing rhetoric of functionaries.},

Males, especially, come to see migration as a normal part of the life course, representing a marker of the transition to manhood, in addition to being a widely accepted vehicle for economic mobility. International migration is cultural in the sense that the aspiration to migrate is transmitted across generations and between people through social networks. In this article, we develop a formal theory of the culture of migration and test it using a special data set collected by the first author as well as data from the Mexican Migration Project. We show that children from families involved in U.S. migration are more likely to aspire to live and work in the U.S. and that these aspirations, in turn, influence their behavior, lowering the odds that they will continue in school, and raising the odds of their eventual outmigration to the U.S.},

One approach theorizes people actively updating their beliefs and behaviors in the face of new information. The other argues that, following early socialization experiences, dispositions are stable. We formalize these two models, elaborate empirical implications of each, and derive a simple combined model for comparing them using panel data. We test this model on 183 attitude and behavior items from the 2006 to 2014 rotating panels of the General Social Survey. The pattern of results is complex but more consistent with the settled dispositions model than with the active updating model. Most of the observed change in the GSS appears to be short-term attitude change or measurement error rather than persisting changes. When persistent change occurs, it is somewhat more likely to occur in younger people and for public behaviors and beliefs about high-profile issues than for private attitudes. We argue that we need both models in our theory of cultural evolution but that we need more research on the circumstances under which each is more likely to apply.},

We argue that residential segregation created a unique niche ofminority clients who were differentially marketed risky subprime loans that were in great demand for use in mortgage-backed securities that could be sold on secondary markets. We test this argument by regressing foreclosure actions in the top 100 U.S. metropolitan areas on measures of black, Hispanic, and Asian segregation while controlling fora variety ofhousing market conditions, including average creditworthiness, the extent of coverage under the Community Reinvest ment Act, the degree of zoning regulation, and the overall rate of subprime lending. We find that black residential dissimilarity and spatial isolation are powerful predictors of fore closures across U.S. metropolitan areas. To isolate subprime lending as the causal mecha nism through which segregation influences foreclosures, we estimate a two-stage least squares model that confirms the causal effect of black segregation on the number and rate of foreclosures across metropolitan areas. We thus conclude that segregation was an impor tant contributing cause of the foreclosure crisis, along with overbuilding, risky lending prac tices, lax regulation, and the bursting of the housing price bubble.},

	abstract = {Technological advances and the big-data revolution have facilitated fine-grained, highfrequency, low-cost measurement of individuals’ work. Yet we understand little about the influences of such quantification of work on workers’ behavior and performance. This article investigates how and when quantification of work affects worker productivity. We argue that quantification affects worker productivity via auto-gamification, or workers’ inadvertent transformation of work into an independent, individual-level game. We further argue that quantification is likely to raise productivity in a context of simple work, where autogamification is motivating because quantified metrics adequately measure the work being performed. When work is complex, by contrast, quantification reduces productivity because quantified metrics cannot adequately measure the multifaceted work being performed, causing auto-gamification to be demotivating. To substantiate our argument, we study implementation of an RFID measurement technology that quantifies individual workers’ output in real time at a garment factory in India. Qualitative evidence uncovers the autogamification mechanism and three conditions that enable it; a natural experiment tests the consequences of quantification of work for worker productivity. This article contributes to the study of quantification, work games, technology, and organizations, and we explore the policy implications of further quantification of work.},

Our results show steep declines in her share of couple earnings following first birth across the three countries that persist over several years of follow-up. Declines are smallest in the United States, due to U.S. mothers’ higher employment and longer work hours. Declines are also smaller among female partners without a college degree in the United States, where mothers have less work-family support and fewer options to manage work and family on one income. Results shed light on how parenthood plays into gender inequality within couples, and how country context shapes couple dynamics and inequality across households.},

The experiments randomly varied the prevalence of weak ties in the networks of over 20 million people over a 5-year period, during which 2 billion new ties and 600,000 new jobs were created. The results provided experimental causal evidence supporting the strength of weak ties and suggested three revisions to the theory. First, the strength of weak ties was nonlinear. Statistical analysis found an inverted U-shaped relationship between tie strength and job transmission such that weaker ties increased job transmission but only to a point, after which there were diminishing marginal returns to tie weakness. Second, weak ties measured by interaction intensity and the number of mutual connections displayed varying effects. Moderately weak ties (measured by mutual connections) and the weakest ties (measured by interaction intensity) created the most job mobility. Third, the strength of weak ties varied by industry. Whereas weak ties increased job mobility in more digital industries, strong ties increased job mobility in less digital industries.

            The influence of weak associations
            
              The strength of weak ties is an influential social-scientific theory that stresses the importance of weak associations (e.g., acquaintance versus close friendship) in influencing the transmission of information through social networks. However, causal tests of this paradoxical theory have proved difficult. Rajkumar
              et al
              . address the question using multiple large-scale, randomized experiments conducted on LinkedIn’s “People You May Know” algorithm, which recommends connections to users (see the Perspective by Wang and Uzzi). The experiments showed that weak ties increase job transmissions, but only to a point, after which there are diminishing marginal returns to tie weakness. The authors show that the weakest ties had the greatest impact on job mobility, whereas the strongest ties had the least. Together, these results help to resolve the apparent “paradox of weak ties” and provide evidence of the strength of weak ties theory. —AMS

	abstract = {This study proposes and applies a novel method for empirically evaluating the role of social structure in the school sorting process. We use administrative records from Baltimore City and suburban Baltimore County public elementary schools (2011 to 2015) to generate a network of schools based on student transfers. We then apply repeated calculations of the Louvian method of community detection to estimate emergent sets of schools that similar parents are likely to consider—which we term emergent consideration sets—and use gravity models to explore the role of social structure, demographics, and geography in observed enrollment patterns. We find that our network-derived emergent consideration sets are better defined by structural boundaries than by student composition or proficiency alone. Within consideration sets, students tend to avoid schools with relatively higher levels of free- and reduced-price meal eligibility and flock toward schools with higher proficiency levels. School racial composition, however, plays a much smaller role in predicting movement between schools, in part because structural constraints generate racially homogeneous consideration sets. Together, these findings highlight how regional social and geographic organization shapes school segregation processes and the policies used to combat them.},

We address this question by drawing on 120 years of “recreations” data (N = 71,393) contained within Who’s Who, a unique catalogue of the British elite. Our results reveal three historical phases of elite cultural distinction: first, a mode of aristocratic practice forged around the leisure possibilities afforded by landed estates, which waned significantly in the late-nineteenth century; second, a highbrow mode dominated by the fine arts, which increased sharply in the early-twentieth century before gently receding in the most recent birth cohorts; and, third, a contemporary mode characterized by the blending of highbrow pursuits with everyday forms of cultural participation, such as spending time with family, friends, and pets. These shifts reveal changes not only in the contents of elite culture but also in the nature of elite distinction, in particular, (1) how the applicability of emulation and (mis)recognition theories has changed over time, and (2) the emergence of a contemporary mode that publicly emphasizes everyday cultural practice (to accentuate ordinariness, authenticity, and cultural connection) while retaining many tastes that continue to be (mis)recognized as legitimate.},

Exogenous shocks can be consequential moments of power consolidation, resource hoarding, and inequality amplification in legitimate organizations, but especially in criminal organizations. This research examines how the exogenous shock of the U.S. prohibition of the production, transportation, and sale of alcohol in 1920 restructured power and inequality in Chicago organized crime. I analyze a unique relational database on organized crime from the early 1900s via a criminal network that tripled in size and centralized during Prohibition. Before Prohibition, Chicago organized crime was small, decentralized, and somewhat inclusive of women at the margins. However, during Prohibition, the organized crime network grew, consolidated the organizational elites, and left out the most vulnerable participants from the most profitable opportunities. This historical case illuminates how profits and organizational restructuring outside of (or in response to) regulatory environments can displace people at the margins.},

No scale currently exists that assesses the positivity of one's social, or collective, identity. A scale was constructed to assess individual differences in collective, rather than personal, self-esteem, with four subscales (Membership esteem, Public collective self-esteem, Private collective self-esteem, and Importance to Identity). Evidence for reliability and validity of the scale was provided by three studies, suggesting that the scale can be a useful research tool.

A large literature documents the extent of low wages and limited fringe benefits, but research has only recently examined the prevalence and consequences of unstable and unpredictable work schedules. Yet practices such as on-call shifts, last minute cancellations, and insufficient work hours are common in the retail and food-service sectors. Little research has examined racial/ethnic inequality in this temporal dimension of job quality, yet precarious scheduling practices may be a significant, if mostly hidden, site for racial/ethnic inequality, because scheduling practices differ significantly between firms and because front-line managers have substantial discretion in scheduling. We draw on innovative matched employer-employee data from The Shift Project to estimate racial/ethnic gaps in these temporal dimensions of job quality and to examine the contribution of firm-level sorting and intra-organizational dynamics to these gaps. We find significant racial/ethnic gaps in exposure to precarious scheduling that disadvantage non-white workers. We provide novel evidence that both firm segregation and racial discordance between workers and managers play significant roles in explaining racial/ethnic gaps in job quality. Notably, we find that racial/ethnic gaps are larger for women than for men.},

However, these two routes are seldom studied together. We develop a theoretical approach to incorporate marriage entry and marital sorting into the intergenerational transmission of family income, accounting for differences between sons and daughters and considering education as a central explanatory factor. Using a novel decomposition method applied to data from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics, we find that marriage plays a major role in intergenerational transmission only among daughters and not until they reach their late-30s. This is more salient in the recent cohort in our data (people born 1963 to 1975). Marital status and marital sorting are comparably important in accounting for the role of marriage, but sorting becomes more important over cohorts. The increasing earnings returns to education over a husband’s career and the weakening association between parental income and daughter’s own earnings explain why marital sorting, and marriage overall, have been growing more important for intergenerational transmission from parents to their daughters.},

I use an original survey experiment to examine how demographic threat affects how White people in the United States classify people who are ambiguously White, and specifically people who are ambiguously White or Latino. The results reveal that White people are less—not more—likely to classify people who are ambiguously White or Latino as “White” under threat. The results contribute to a growing literature on the racial classification of multiracial and racially ambiguous people that has previously ignored ambiguity around the Latino category.

	abstract = {In many industries, managers face the problem of selling a given stock of items by a deadline. We investigate the problem of dynamically pricing such inventories when demand is price sensitive and stochastic and the firm's objective is to maximize expected revenues. Examples that fit this framework include retailers selling fashion and seasonal goods and the travel and leisure industry, which markets space such as seats on airline flights, cabins on vacation cruises, and rooms in hotels that become worthless if not sold by a specific time.
            We formulate this problem using intensity control and obtain structural monotonicity results for the optimal intensity (resp., price) as a function of the stock level and the length of the horizon. For a particular exponential family of demand functions, we find the optimal pricing policy in closed form. For general demand functions, we find an upper bound on the expected revenue based on analyzing the deterministic version of the problem and use this bound to prove that simple, fixed price policies are asymptotically optimal as the volume of expected sales tends to infinity. Finally, we extend our results to the case where demand is compound Poisson; only a finite number of prices is allowed; the demand rate is time varying; holding costs are incurred and cash flows are discounted; the initial stock is a decision variable; and reordering, overbooking, and random cancellations are allowed.},

What caused the Great Recession? Why do some countries grow faster than others? Identification of causal effects plays two roles in this process. In certain cases, progress can be made using the direct approach of identifying plausibly exogenous variation in a policy and using this variation to assess the effect of the policy. However, external validity concerns limit what can be learned in this way. Carefully identified causal effects estimates can also be used as moments in a structural moment matching exercise. We use the term “identified moments” as a short-hand for “estimates of responses to identified structural shocks,” or what applied microeconomists would call “causal effects.” We argue that such identified moments are often powerful diagnostic tools for distinguishing between important classes of models (and thereby learning about the effects of policy). To illustrate these notions we discuss the growing use of cross-sectional evidence in macroeconomics and consider what the best existing evidence is on the effects of monetary policy.},

We introduce the notion of “connected substitutes” and show that this structure is sufficient for invertibility. The connected substitutes conditions require weak substitution between all goods and sufficient strict substitution to necessitate treating them in a single demand system. The connected substitutes conditions have transparent economic interpretation, are easily checked, and are satisfied in many standard models. They need only hold under some transformation of demand and can accommodate many models in which goods are complements. They allow one to show invertibility without strict gross substitutes, functional form restrictions, smoothness assumptions, or strong domain restrictions. When the restriction to weak substitutes is maintained, our sufficient conditions are also “nearly necessary” for even local invertibility.},

assumes that agents cannot process all available information, but they can choose which exact pieces of information to attend to. Several important results in economics have been built around imperfect information. 
Nowadays, many more forms of information than ever before are available due to new technologies, and yet we are able to digest little of it. Which form of imperfect information we possess and act upon is thus largely 
determined by which information we choose to pay attention to. These choices are driven by current economic conditions and imply behavior that features numerous empirically supported departures from standard models. 
Combining these insights about human limitations with the optimizing approach of neoclassical economics yields a new, generally applicable model.},

This debate is particularly evident in the program/policy evaluation literature, where reduced-form (experimental or quasi-experimental) and structural modeling approaches are often viewed as rival methodologies. Reduced-form proponents criticize the assumptions invoked in structural applications. Structural 
modeling advocates point to the limitations of reduced-form approaches in not being able to inform about program impacts prior to implementation or about the costs and benefits of program designs that deviate from the 
one that was implemented. In this paper, we argue that there is a new emerging view of a natural synergy between these two approaches, that they can be melded to exploit the advantages and ameliorate the disadvantages 
of each. We provide examples of how data from randomized controlled trials (RCTs), the exemplar of reduced form practitioners, can be used to enhance the credibility of structural estimation. We also illustrate how the 
structural approach complements experimental analyses by enabling evaluation of counterfactual policies/programs. Lastly, we survey many recent studies that combine these methodologies in various ways across different subfields within economics.},

Overall, total hours worked in the firm decreased significantly, showing imperfect substitutability between workers and hours. The effects differ by gender: part-time female workers were replaced by full-time male workers. Importantly, reduced-form evidence indicates the reallocation of workers from firms highly exposed to the policy to firms less exposed. To quantify the aggregate impact taking into account these effects, I build and estimate a search and matching model with heterogeneous workers and firms. I find that the minimum workweek destroyed 1\% of jobs but had no effect on total hours, due to positive general equilibrium effects. Finally, the gender gap in welfare increased by 3\% because women were more affected by the direct negative employment effects and benefited less from reallocation effects.},

	abstract = {This paper studies regulated health insurance markets known as exchanges, motivated by the increasingly important role they play in both public and private insurance provision. We develop a framework that combines data on health outcomes and insurance plan choices for a population of insured individuals with a model of a competitive insurance exchange to predict outcomes under different exchange designs. We apply this framework to examine the effects of regulations that govern insurers’ ability to use health status information in pricing. We investigate the welfare implications of these regulations with an emphasis on two potential sources of inefﬁciency: (i) adverse selection and (ii) premium reclassiﬁcation risk. We ﬁnd substantial adverse selection leading to full unraveling of our simulated exchange, even when age can be priced. While the welfare cost of adverse selection is substantial when health status cannot be priced, that of reclassiﬁcation risk is ﬁve times larger when insurers can price based on some health status information. We investigate several extensions including (i) contract design regulation, (ii) self-insurance through saving and borrowing, and (iii) insurer risk adjustment transfers.},

We present a model of competition between flexible and dedicated sellers (peer hosts and hotels) who provide differentiated products. We estimate this model using data from major US cities and quantify the welfare effects of Airbnb on travelers, hosts, and hotels. The welfare gains are concentrated in specific locations (New York) and times (New Year’s Eve) when hotel capacity is constrained. This occurs because peer hosts are responsive to market conditions, expand supply as hotels fill up, and keep hotel prices down as a result. (JEL L11, L83, L86, L88, Z31)},

The optimal price schedule is a multi-part tariff, featuring tiers within which buyers pay a marginal price of zero. We apply our model to digital goods, for which advertising, data generation, and network effects make usage valuable, but monitoring legitimate usage is infeasible. Our results rationalize common pricing schemes including free products, free trials, and unlimited subscriptions. The possibility of free disposal harms producer and consumer welfare and makes both less sensitive to changes in usage-based revenue and demand. (JEL D11, D21, D42, L86, M37)},

We also argue that current threshold levels likely are too lax, unless one expects efficiency gains of 5 percent or greater, or other factors such as entry and product repositioning to significantly constrain the exercise of market power postmerger.

The model embeds a large set of applications ranging from sponsored search advertising to credit scores to information sharing among competitors. We then review a mechanism design approach to selling information in greater detail. We distinguish between ex ante sales of information (the buyer acquires an information structure) and ex post sales (the buyer pays for speciﬁc realizations). We relate this distinction to the diﬀerent products that brokers, advertisers, and publishers use to trade consumer information online. We discuss the endogenous limits to the trade of information that derive from its potential adverse use for consumers. Finally we revisit the role of recommender systems and artiﬁcial intelligence systems as markets for indirect information.},

We emphasize a metaphorical interpretation, under which the information design problem is used by the analyst to characterize play in the game under many different information structures. We provide an introduction to the basic issues and insights of a rapidly growing literature in information design. We show how the literal and metaphorical interpretations of information design unify a large body of existing work, including that on communication in games (Myerson 1991), Bayesian persuasion (Kamenica and Gentzkow 2011), and some of our own recent work on robust predictions in games of incomplete information.

	abstract = {Traders that arrive over time give rise to a dynamic tradeoff between the benefits of increasing gains from trade by accumulating traders and the associated cost of delay due to discounting. We analyze this tradeoff in a dynamic bilateral trade model in which a buyer and seller arrive in each period and draw their types independently from commonly known distributions. With symmetric binary types, the optimal market clearing policy can be implemented with posted prices and ex post budget balance, provided that it is optimal to store at least one trader. While optimally thick markets involve storing a small number of traders, their performance is nevertheless close to that of a large market. In particular, irrespective of the type distributions, two-thirds of the gains from increased market thickness can be achieved by storing just one trader.},

	abstract = {We provide a parsimonious and unified explanation for randomized selling mechanisms widely used in practice yet commonly perceived as puzzling. Optimality of randomization in the form of conflation and rationing implies that revenue under market-clearing pricing is nonconcave. Randomization is implementable via opaque pricing and underpricing. Relative to market-clearing pricing, randomization increases the equilibrium quantity and quality of goods sold and, consequently, may increase consumer surplus. For fixed quantities, resale increases consumer surplus. However, resale can decrease the equilibrium quantity and quality of goods sold. Thus, resale prohibition, which always benefits the seller, may also increase consumer surplus.},
